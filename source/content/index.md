## Intro
- Hi! Welcome to my digital scrapbook :) 
- It currently serves a few purposes:
	- **Thinking in public**
		- E.g. [[Should I meditate regularly?]], [[What I currently know about Bowen family systems theory]], [[06. Learning the Socratic method, part 1 → the rationale]], [[How can I operate from a place of uncertainty?]], [[08. Enneagram 3 thinking sins]]
		- I'm finding that having something that is publicly visible acts as a really great incentive to write more. 
		- Stuff published here feels much more "real" than stuff that I might write for myself and then lose in a giant overwhelming Obsidian vault, or that gets tucked away in a Google Drive folder, never to be seen again.

	- **Focusing on my open questions**
		- [[⭐️"How can I improve my ability to think? (Open Question)]]
		- [[⭐️"How can I change how to orient to my family?" (Open Question)]]
		- [[⭐️"How should I make money?" (Open Question)]]
		- [[⭐️"How do I meditate regularly?" (Open Question)]]
	- **Something akin to accountability?**
		- E.g. [[Meditation log]]
