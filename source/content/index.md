*My main website is [here](https://www.alexislearning.me/) - this website is my notebook for learning how to think the Open Research Institute way* ðŸ˜Ž

--

As of 2025-06-12, I am a member of the [Open Research Institute](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/how-do-we-bootstrap-the-open-research?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2)!

I'm going to log my process of "learning how to think". My newest project re: this is inspired by [this post by Defender of Basic](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/geoffrey-hinton-on-developing-your). 

# Day 1
*Note that these both link to my other website right now, kinda redundant/confusing, I'll be doing all future 'learning to think' updates on this website where you currently are*

- [Log of what I did on day 1](https://www.alexislearning.me/learning/2025-06-11-learning-to-think-day-1/) â†’ I followed his guide, made a twitter alt, found some people and tried to predict why they were so mad at AOC, saying that Delaware is toast and Ohio is gonna rise, etc
