# Intro
- Hi! Welcome to my ==digital scrapbook== :) 
-  ![[profile-pic-pixel.png|120]]
- It currently serves a few purposes:
## 1. Focusing on my open questions
- [[⭐️"How can I improve my ability to think? (Open Question)]]
- [[⭐️"How can I change how to orient to my family?" (Open Question)]]
- [[⭐️"How should I make money?" (Open Question)]]
- [[⭐️"How do I meditate regularly?" (Open Question)]]
## 2. Thinking in public
- E.g. 
	- [[Should I meditate regularly?]]
	- [[What I currently know about Bowen family systems theory]] 
	- [[06. Learning the Socratic method, part 1 → the rationale|Learning the Socratic Method]]
	- [[How can I operate from a place of uncertainty?]]
	- [[08. Enneagram 3 thinking sins|Enneagram 3 thinking sins]]
- This has the great benefit of getting me to ==think more clearly & robustly==
- It also may lead to me ==making more stuff== - substack posts, youtube videos, etc
	- [[Lemon tree → lemon curd → lemon pie 🍋]], where this place is me picking lemons, super low effort, may turn them into lemon curd later, maybe not
