## Hello!
- As of 2025-06-12, I am a member of the [Open Research Institute](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/how-do-we-bootstrap-the-open-research?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2)!
- This website is me learning how to think via top-down learning, vs the [[Bottom-up learning]] that I've almost entirely used up until this point
- This is inspired by [this post by Defender of Basic](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/geoffrey-hinton-on-developing-your). 
- Kickoff post with a quick sketch of why I'm doing this - [here](https://www.alexislearning.me/learning-how-to-think/)
## Daily learning log
