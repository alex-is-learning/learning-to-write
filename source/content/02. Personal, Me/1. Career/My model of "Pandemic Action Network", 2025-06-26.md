# Model from 2 days of orientation
- 2025-06-26
- I've spent two days orienting (in the Boydian sense) to [Pandemic Action Network](https://www.pandemicactionnetwork.org/)
- Aim - to have a thorough grasp of who they are, what they do, what they've done, and their theory of change
- There's a lot to learn! This is not a scrappy little effective altruist org with a simple mission/not much available info → they have 5 annual reports and they've done a *lot* of amazing stuff
- I now have a neat Miro board full of visual notes about them ([slide deck of visual notes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15rrsNpgGta1bJhfBIRhKg3DPcdUPFfWS-ugrwBg06F8/edit?slide=id.g36292da8d7e_0_178#slide=id.g36292da8d7e_0_178))
- ![[Pasted image 20250626065326.png]]
- Post-it notes indicate things that I currently don't understand/open questions, to look into later, in the Michael Nielsen "iterative deepening" way (from [[Bottom-up learning]], also [[Hermeneutic circle, hermeneutic spiral]])
- I still haven't made any flashcards, I'm going to test what I've grokked just from actively engaging with the info as I've ordered it, condensed it, adding hierarchies etc
	- See [[Are visual notes underrated and poorly understood?]]
# Pandemic Action Network
## The basics
- Founded in 2020 by Eloise Todd and colleagues
- Lean team that leverages a network of other orgs
- Key civil society voice in global health, pandemic preparedness, COVID response
- Now has a network of 400+ collaborator orgs, including:
	- ~66% of collaborators are civil service organisations (CSOs), ~33% are African CSOs
	- Also think tanks, governments, charities, research groups, private sector, media
- ~70 collaborators in network in first year, now 400+
## Theory of change 
- Agile, non-bureaucratic, rapid pace
- Leverage diverse network of 400+ orgs in order to create policy documents
- Policy docs are deeply informed by diverse network
- Signal boosting - can coordinate across network to spread message(s)
- Key organiser of various things, key voice, kind of _the_ org at the middle of this hub-and-spoke model
- ![[Pasted image 20250626070432.png]]
- Led to huge outcomes like (and this is where flashcards will be useful)
	- Summits 
	- WHO things
	- Pandemic Fund
	- They really feel like the adults in the room (vs e.g. little scrappy effective altruism startups). Huge expertise, playing at the very top of the world stage, working with WHO and governments etc. Absurdly high leverage
- Also led initiatives like:
	- COVID ambassadors
	- Mask drives early in COVID
	- Getting PPE to frontline workers in Africa. Some absurd figures here like 300 million + PPE items delivered
## {NOTE TO SELF - make flashcards about outcomes}
# Day 3 → answering open questions
- I feel torn between learning more, orienting more deeply, and applying
- I definitely don't feel like I have a deep understanding of what they've *done* yet, because my model of e.g. how the WHO works, what the Pandemic Fund is, is poor
- I think spending a third day getting to grips with stuff here, and making flashcards, will make me much more fluent in these topics if I get an interview
- I'm a little worried that they'll take the listing down soon as it's been up for ages. But you'd think that p(them taking it down in the next day or two) would be low...

## Open questions/things I don't grok yet:
- Writing up my post-it notes from [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15rrsNpgGta1bJhfBIRhKg3DPcdUPFfWS-ugrwBg06F8/edit?slide=id.g36292da8d7e_0_178#slide=id.g36292da8d7e_0_178)
1. What is the Pandemic Fund? Who is involved? Etc
2. What summits have PAN helped organise? How did they contribute?
3. What pandemic agreements were PAN involved with?
4. What actually is civil society? Just a basic definition would be useful, and some key examples
5. What does PPR stand for, want to lock this in. Pandemic Preparedness and Readiness?
6. I'd like to make a quick org chart just to get a better sense of what teams exist
7. What are ODA promises?
8. What are IHRs?
9. Who is working on a holistic pandemic agreement? Who are the stakeholders here?
10. I know barely anything about the WHO!
11. What are global public goods?
12. What is the debt common framework?
13. What are SDRs?
14. Learn more about "all global health initiatives", including Gavi, Global Fund, WHO, etc
	1. "This also entails ensuring all global health initiatives, including **Gavi**, the **Global Fund**, **WHO**, and the **Pandemic Fund**, are fully financed"
15. How do you strengthen LMIC leadership roles in the Pandemic Fund?
16. Learn more about RANA
17. I don't really know what e.g. a Think Tank is/does. I mean, I have a guess (they work on policy?), but it'd be great to double check this and learn about some quintessential examples (Adam Smith Institute?)
18. Pandemic Agreement by WHO member states - what it involves
19. "COP-like" - quickly learn about COP
	1. PAN advocates for a "COP-like" process for pandemics, which would institute annual accountability mechanisms to hold global leaders responsible for preparedness
20. Broader financial reforms (e.g., Multilateral Development Bank reform)
21. CAF-Africa
	1. In 2020, CAF-Africa was the fifth largest procurement mechanism for PPE in the world. Between June 2020 and March 2022, CAF-Africa:
22. Lock in their key strategic pillars
	1. **Advocacy for Equitable Access to Pandemic Tools**
	2. **Driving Global Summits and High-Level Political Engagement**
	3. **Role in the Establishment and Funding of the Pandemic Fund**
	4. **Engagement in the Pandemic Instrument Process**
	5. **Promoting Accountability and Cross-Sectoral Collaboration**
	6. **Targeted Programs**
23. Lock in their key strategic initiatives
	1. **Pandemic Action Ambassadors**
	2. **From the Frontline**
	3. **Vaccine Education**
	4. **COVID-19 Action Fund for Africa (CAF-Africa)**
	5. **Mask Behavior**
	6. **Resilience Action Network Africa (RANA)**
24. "Panic & neglect" - who first came up with this term? Does it just apply to pandemic preparedness?
25. ACT-A?
26. Newsletter, weekly calls
27. "Equitable successor to ACT-A"
28. Africa CDC's New Public Health Order
29. The Elders? UNGA?
30. Resilience & Sustainability Trust
31. "Expert commission to cost climate & pandemic-resilient health systems"
32. IDA-21?
33. Africa Epidemic Fund
34. "global-public-investment model"
35. MDB reforms
36. "One-Health based pandemic agreement"
37. mpox
38. H5N1
39. MFF hub
40. Resilient debt clause
41. ODA
42. Shift overton window re: security sector arguements
## An overview of the global health landscape would be very useful for scaffolding

Gemini deep research prompt

```
please make an overview of the global health landscape, with a focus on Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response

I want an overview of the key players (e.g. WHO, pandemic action network)

things like funds, RANA, Africa CDC's New Public Health Order, the CDC, etc
