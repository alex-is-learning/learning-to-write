# Day 3 → answering open questions
- I feel torn between learning more, orienting more deeply, and applying
- I definitely don't feel like I have a deep understanding of what they've *done* yet, because my model of e.g. how the WHO works, what the Pandemic Fund is, is poor
- I think spending a third day getting to grips with stuff here, and making flashcards, will make me much more fluent in these topics if I get an interview
- I'm a little worried that they'll take the listing down soon as it's been up for ages. But you'd think that p(them taking it down in the next day or two) would be low...

## Open questions/things I don't grok yet:
- Writing up my post-it notes from [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15rrsNpgGta1bJhfBIRhKg3DPcdUPFfWS-ugrwBg06F8/edit?slide=id.g36292da8d7e_0_178#slide=id.g36292da8d7e_0_178)
### 1. Learning basics/getting scaffolding
1. What actually is civil society? Just a basic definition would be useful, and some key examples
2. What does PPR stand for, want to lock this in. Pandemic Preparedness and Readiness?
3. I know barely anything about the WHO!

	1. "This also entails ensuring all global health initiatives, including **Gavi**, the **Global Fund**, **WHO**, and the **Pandemic Fund**, are fully financed"
6. I don't really know what e.g. a Think Tank is/does. I mean, I have a guess (they work on policy?), but it'd be great to double check this and learn about some quintessential examples (Adam Smith Institute?)
7. "COP-like" - quickly learn about COP
	1. PAN advocates for a "COP-like" process for pandemics, which would institute annual accountability mechanisms to hold global leaders responsible for preparedness
8. "Panic & neglect" - who first came up with this term? Does it just apply to pandemic preparedness?
### 2. Learn more about the specifics of PAN
1. I'd like to make a quick org chart just to get a better sense of what teams exist
2. Lock in their key strategic pillars
	1. Advocacy for Equitable Access to Pandemic Tools

8. Africa CDC's New Public Health Order
9. The Elders? 
10. UNGA?
11. Resilience & Sustainability Trust
12. "Expert commission to cost climate & pandemic-resilient health systems"
13. Africa Epidemic Fund

### 4. Learning technical stuff 
1. What are ODA promises?
2. What are IHRs?
3. What is the debt common framework?
4. What are SDRs?
5. How do you strengthen LMIC leadership roles in the Pandemic Fund?
6. Learn more about RANA

10. MFF hub
11. Resilient debt clause
12. ODA
### 5. Specific disease responses
1. mpox
2. H5N1
3. COVID
## An overview of the global health landscape would be very useful for scaffolding

Gemini deep research prompt

```
please make an overview of the global health landscape, with a focus on Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response

I want an overview of the key players (e.g. WHO, pandemic action network)

things like funds, RANA, Africa CDC's New Public Health Order, the CDC, etc
```

- ☝️ I love deep research so so much
- Ah, I shouldn't have specified orgs as examples, as it over-indexed on them 
- So I also asked ChatGPT o3:
	- `who are the key players in global health & pandemic PPR?` 
- And got a very useful answer
## Key players in PPR
Below is a snapshot of the organisations, forums and funding mechanisms that now anchor **Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness & Response (PPR)** on the world stage.  I’ve grouped them loosely by function so you can see who does what and why each matters.

---

### **1.  Global rule-setting and technical authority**

  

**World Health Organization (WHO)** – still the hub for surveillance norms (International Health Regulations) and, as of **May 2025, the new Pandemic Agreement**, which countries say will hard-wire equitable access, One-Health surveillance and R&D/benefit-sharing into international law. 

---

### **2.  Big-ticket public finance**

- **The Pandemic Fund (World Bank)** – multilateral trust fund created in 2022; channels concessional grants to low- and middle-income countries for lab networks, workforce and surveillance. A third call for proposals (US $500 m) opened in March 2025, but pledges still total only about US $2 billion, far short of demand. 
    
- **International Monetary Fund – Resilience & Sustainability Trust (RST)** – offers long-term, low-interest loans that explicitly list pandemic preparedness alongside climate as a priority; guidance for using the instrument was updated in March 2025. 
    
- **G20 Joint Finance-Health Task Force** – political forum that tries to keep finance and health ministers aligned on PPR spending and crisis financing rules. 
    

---

### **3.  Rapid R&D and counter-measures**

- **CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations)** – mission is “vaccines in 100 days.” Still raising money (new awards announced late-2024/early-2025) for prototype-pathogen and manufacturing-network projects. 
    
- **Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance** – manages global stockpiles (e.g., Ebola, cholera) and is now pitching itself as the immunisation arm of pandemic preparedness; ongoing 2025 pledging round shows both philanthropic support and donor cuts. 
    
- **Unitaid & the Global Fund** – finance test-and-treat tools and health-system capacity that double as outbreak-response assets (no recent headline in our quick scan, but they sit in the PPR architecture).
    

---

### **4.  Philanthropic & private-sector heavyweights**

- **Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation** – largest non-state funder of WHO and CEPI; more than US $2 billion committed to COVID-19 and follow-on PPR work, with long-term pledges through 2045. 
    
- **Wellcome Trust** – influential on research-funding and policy; publicly backed the Pandemic Agreement in May 2025. 
    
- **IFPMA / Pharmaceutical & biotech industry coalitions** – lobby the G7 and others on R&D incentives, IP, and manufacturing scale-ups. 
    

---

### **5.  Regional public-health powerhouses**

- **Africa CDC** – coordinates continent-wide surveillance, stockpiles and emergency response; issues weekly intelligence briefs and leads Africa’s voice in treaty talks. 
    
- **PAHO (Americas), ECDC (Europe) and newly proposed ASEAN CDC** – act as regional early-warning and technical-assistance hubs.
    
- **Resilience Action Network Africa (RANA)** – civil-society complement that feeds local priorities into Africa CDC and global forums. 
    

---

### **6.  Political and summit diplomacy forums**

- **G7** – Health-ministers track keeps “Pact for Pandemic Readiness” items (R&D, surveillance, AMR) alive in annual communiqués. 
    
- **United Nations** – the 2024 UN High-Level Meeting on PPR laid groundwork for treaty adoption and for integrating climate, debt and gender lenses into preparedness financing.
    

---

### **7.  Civil-society and advocacy networks**

- **Pandemic Action Network (PAN)** and allies – organise NGO, academic and private-sector voices to lobby for treaty provisions and to close the US $8 - 10 billion annual PPR financing gap. 
    
- **ONE Campaign, Global Citizen, MSF, Red Cross/IFRC** – keep political pressure on leaders for equitable access and sustained financing.
    

---

### **8.  Think-tanks & expert coalitions**

- Academic centres (e.g., Johns Hopkins CHS, Georgetown CSET) and initiatives such as the **100 Days Mission** steer technical standards and benchmark country readiness. 
    

---

**Why this matters:**  None of these actors can “do PPR” alone.  The money (World Bank/IMF), the norms (WHO), the science push (CEPI, Gavi, Wellcome), the political cover (G7/G20/UN) and the ground-truthing by regional bodies and civil society all have to line up.  Tracking who is taking the lead in each lane is the surest way to see where the gaps—and the leverage points—still lie.
