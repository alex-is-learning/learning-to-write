The World Health Organisation (WHO) is the principal international authority dedicated to {{c1::global public health}}
|
The WHO's vision is 
"{{c1::a world in which all peoples 
attain the highest possible level of health}}"
|
The WHO's mission is (3 things)
{{c1::promote health}}, 
{{c1::ensure global safety}}, 
and {{c1::serve vulnerable populations}}
|
The WHO constitution was adopted in year {{c1::1948}} 
|
The WHO's broad definition of health encompasses social determinants like 
(3 things)
{{c1::education, 
housing, 
economic stability}}
|
A criticism of the WHO's definition of health is that 
{{c1::it may be expanding its scope 
beyond what it can effectively handle}}
|
The idea for a global health organisation was proposed at 
{{c1::the United Nations Conference}} 
in year {{c1::1945}}
|
The WHO is a specialised agency of 
{{c1::the United Nations}}
|
The WHO's structure as 
{{c1::an intergovernmental organisation}} 
limits its enforcement power, as 
{{c1::it relies on the voluntary compliance of member states}}
|
The WHO's central headquarters is located in 
{{c1::Geneva, Switzerland}}
|
The supreme decision-making body of the WHO is 
{{c1::the World Health Assembly (WHA)}}
|
In global health, WHA stands for 
{{c1::World Health Assembly}}
|
One of the WHO's core functions is setting global health {{c1::norms and standards}}
|
The effectiveness of the WHO's normative power is contingent on 
{{c1::the political will and capacity 
of its member states 
to implement global standards}}
|
A critical responsibility of the WHO is to lead and coordinate 
{{c1::the global response to health crises}}
|
The {{c1::International Health Regulations (IHR)}} are a legal framework
defining countries' obligations 
in managing public health events with international implications
|
In global health, PHEIC stands for 
{{c1::Public Health Emergency of International Concern}}
|
The WHO's Director-General has the authority to declare a {{c1::PHEIC}}
|
In global health, WHE stands for
WHO Health Emergencies Programme
|
The WHE faces challenges such as 
(2 things)
{{c1::
Delays in recruitment
Insufficient security support for staff in high-risk areas}}
|
A major financial challenge for the WHO is that 
{{c1::a large portion of its funding is earmarked, 
which limits flexibility in resource allocation}}
|
The WHO's response to major crises 
like Ebola and the COVID-19 pandemic 
was perceived by some as 
{{c1::"too slow"}}
|
The WHO promotes 
{{c1::PHC}} 
as the foundational approach for achieving 
{{c2::UHC}}
|
A monumental achievement of the WHO was 
{{c1::the declaration of the eradication of smallpox}} 
in year {{c1::1980}}
|
The Global Polio Eradication Initiative was launched by the WHO in {{c1::1988}}
```
## 2 
```
The GPEI's strategy has resulted in 
{{c1::over a 99% reduction in global polio incidence}}
|
The two countries where wild poliovirus transmission may not have been fully interrupted are 
{{c1::Pakistan}} 
and 
{{c1::Afghanistan}}
|
Key factors for the success of disease eradication campaigns include 
(3 things)
{{c1::a disease reservoir exclusively in humans
effective vaccines, 
and sustained global political will}}
|
The WHO's initial response to the 
{{c1::HIV/AIDS epidemic}} 
was characterised by staff downplaying the severity of the crisis
|
{{c1::UNAIDS}} 
was created to spearhead the global HIV/AIDS response, 
partly because 
{{c1::the WHO's initial response was perceived as insufficient}}
|
The "{{c1::95-95-95}}" targets for HIV/AIDS 
aim for 
(4 lines)
{{c1::95% of people with HIV to know their status, 
95% on treatment, 
and 95% with viral suppression
by 2025}}
|
Major risk factors for NCDs include 
(5 things)
{{c1::tobacco use, 
physical inactivity, 
harmful alcohol consumption, 
unhealthy diets, 
air pollution}}
|
Preventing NCDs requires a {{c1::multi-sectoral}} approach 
that {{c1::extends beyond traditional medical interventions 
to engage with industries like food, tobacco, and alcohol}}
|
The WHO's ambitious target is to ensure 
{{c1::one billion more}} people benefit from UHC 
by 
year {{c1::2025}}
|
Despite being a strategic priority, progress towards 
{{c1::UHC}} 
has stagnated since 2015
|
In 2021, an estimated {{c1::4.5 billion}} people 
were not fully covered by essential health services
|
The WHO advocates for a 
{{c1::PHC}} approach 
as the most effective and cost-efficient way to achieve 
{{c2::UHC}}
|
The WHO {{c1::WHE}} 
works with countries and partners 
to 
{{c2::prepare for, prevent, detect, and respond to disease outbreaks}}
|
Operational challenges for the WHE include (3 things)
{{c1::delays in recruitment, 
the absence of an integrated supply chain, 
and inadequate security support for staff}}
|
The WHO's funding is derived from two primary sources: 
{{c1::assessed contributions (ACs)}} 
and 
{{c1::voluntary contributions (VCs)}} 
|
When talking about the WHO
AC stands for {{c1::Assessed Contribution}}
VC stands for {{c1::Voluntary Contribution}}
|
WHO ACs are 
{{c1::mandatory membership dues from Member States }}
and historically have 
{{c1::covered less than 20% of the total budget}}
|
VCs constitute the vast majority of the WHO's financing, 
making up 
{{c1::81%}} 
of total funding in the 2022-23 period
|
Major VCs to the WHO include 
(5)
{{c1::The US
Germany 
The GAVI Alliance 
The European Commission 
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation}}
}}
|
The WHO's heavy reliance on 
{{c1::VCs}} 
Creates a fundamental vulnerability for the organisation
```
## 3
```
The World Health Organisation's (WHO) financial structure significantly influences its 
{{c1::operational flexibility}} and 
{{c1::strategic autonomy}}
|
WHO ACs are calculated based on 
{{c1::a country's wealth and population}}
|
(Problem)
While WHO ACs are {{c1::flexible}}, 
VCs are "{{c1::overwhelmingly earmarked}}", 
meaning 
{{c1::donors dictate how the funds are used}}
|
The earmarked nature of VCs effectively 
"{{c1::transfers power from WHO to donors}}" 
|
Earmarked funding can impede 
{{c1::swift responses in emergencies }}
and 
{{c1::complicate long-term planning}}
as 
{{c1::funds are tied to short-term donor interests}}
|
The WHO's CFE stands for 
{{c1::Contingency Fund for Emergencies}}
|
The WHO's {{c1::CFE}} has been reported as drying up"
|
A recent WHO decision aims to 
Increase {{c1::ACs}} to cover {{c1::50%}} of the WHO's base budget 
by {{c1::2030}}
|
Beyond smallpox and polio, 
the WHO has significantly reduced mortality from diseases like 
{{c1::malaria and tuberculosis}} through its programmes
|
A key strength of the WHO is its ability to strengthen health systems by
(3 things)
{{c1::improving infrastructure, 
training healthcare workers, 
and promoting robust health information systems}}.
|
The WHO's greatest strength lies in its 
{{c1::convening power}} 
and 
{{c1::normative authority}}, 
|
Critics argue the WHO's IHR framework 
{{c1::has a "lack of teeth" 
in its legal enforcement mechanisms}}
|
The commitment to 
{{c1::increase ACs to 50% of the base budget by 2030}} 
is considered the cornerstone of WHO's transformation"
