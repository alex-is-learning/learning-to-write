A civil-society organisation (CSO) is 
{{c1::any non-state, non-profit, voluntary group 
that people create to pursue shared interests, values or causes in the public sphere.}}
|
What a CSO being "voluntary" means:
{{c1::A company exists to generate profit for owners
A ministry exists because the state mandates it.
A CSO exists only because a group of people decided, “Let’s band together for this cause.”
If the members walk away—or donors stop giving—the organisation disappears.
There is no statutory charter or shareholder-value obligation keeping it alive.
|
The 4 ingredients of a CSO:
{{c1::
- Independent of government – not an arm of the state, though it may partner or lobby governments.
- Not-for-profit – surplus funds are reinvested in the mission, not distributed to owners or shareholders
- Voluntary participation – people choose to join, donate or work because they care about the aim.
- Public-interest purpose – seeks social, environmental, cultural or humanitarian benefit rather than private gain.
