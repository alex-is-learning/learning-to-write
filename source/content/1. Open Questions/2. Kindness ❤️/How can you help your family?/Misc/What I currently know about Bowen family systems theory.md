- Following on from [[Current family project open questions]]
- I've probably ~10 hours reading [Kerr's book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bowen-Theorys-Secrets-Revealing-Families/dp/0393708128), making flashcards etc
	- [[Bowen family systems - flashcards]]
- I'm wary of the failure mode of "learn, learn, learn", and barely using the knowledge. This has been a huge pattern for me! 99% of the anki flashcards I've ever made, I've ended up deleting, and being like "...why the hell did I think *English medieval history* was the highest leverage thing for me to learn, smh"
	- [[The Consume-Create Ratio]]
- So, even though part of me is like "but I haven't read the whole book yet!" - feels worthwhile to write up my current understanding (or a summary, at least)
# Bowen family theory 
- Made by Murray Bowen, who started working on it in 1946, worked on it until his death in 1990. Then Michael Kerr became the main guy (they collaborated for years)
# Main points
## 1. The family as a key emotional system
- In a thing that rhymes nicely with the "[Extended Mind](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3328150)" hypothesis - our emotional system isn't just a certain part of our brain (uhh, precortex?) - our emotional system includes the system of relationships that we exist in 
- This is a very underrated fact, a kind of "anti-meme". It's very obvious in retrospect, but very easy to miss. 
	- Partly this may be due to our individualistic culture. 
	- Partly it may be due to feelings of intractability - if you have a difficult family, it's much easier to leave, work on yourself, reduce contact, etc. 
### Metaphor â†’ the wind
- The *extended* emotional system (my phrase) is like the wind - it's invisible, but you can see the effects it has on *people*
- You can't see the wind, but you can see the trees swaying. You can't see the emotional system, but you can see the effects it has on people
- (The wind is typically anxiety. Anxiety travels around the extended emotional system â†’ if one family member is anxious, and e.g. rants to another, then they're handing some anxiety to the other)
#### 2 ways the metaphor isn't perfect
1. You create (some of the) wind
	- As a member of your "extended emotional system", you actually create some of the wind. You have agency, you are a node in the system. You can control your reactions. You can increase the total anxiety in the system, or decrease it. You can *create or dampen the wind*
2. You can choose your reactions to the wind (to a certain extent)
	- You can control your reaction to the "wind" of others. A tree is buffeted about, but you can, through being mindful, having better concepts, more awareness, etc, *choose* to react less
		- This rhymes heavily with the quote which is often incorrectly attributed to Victor Frankl - "*Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom*"
		- I learned about this through [Michael Ashcroft's writing on Alexander Technique](https://expandingawareness.org/blog/what-is-the-alexander-technique/), which seems like it'd be a great technique for reducing your reactive "wind-creation"
### Disempowering in some ways
- "You might not like being compared to an ant in an ant colony, where the actions of one ant don't make much sense unless looked at through the lens of the entire colony, and the ant doesn't really have free will, it's just following the cues of the colony. But too bad, you lil bitch"
- (Very "complex adaptive systems" vibes, which makes sense seeing as Bowen's theory is an offshoot of Bertalaffny's "complex systems" theory. Emergence, "complex emergent high-level phenomena appearing from simple low-level rules/interactions", etc)
### Empowering in other ways
- You can choose to create less anxiety in the system
- You can choose to be less reactive
- You can "upskill" and change the system
## 2. Systems thinking, not cause-and-effect thinking
### No one is to blame
- No one person is to blame â†’ you're in a system
- ðŸ‘‡ this kinda vibe
- ![[What I currently know about Bowen family systems theory.png]]
- Even in the "the husband is really domineering", it's not just the husband - the wife also assumes the submissive/adaptive position, "goes along with it" in order to prevent arguments. So it's not "the husband causes the situation", it a reciprocal thing
### You can't change other people directly, but you are an agent in the system
- But you can change yourself, and you're embedded in a system, you'll therefore change the system
- Like it there were 10 ants that were constantly high anxiety and aggressive, and then one learned to be less anxious and reactive - the anxiety in the system has now reduced 
- *Will return to how to change the system in a later heading*

## 3. Closeness vs distance

## 4. "Differentiation of self"
## 5. The four patterns of... conflict?
- These are called something kind of bland (see [[The terrible pedagogy of (Michael Kerr's version of) Bowen Family Systems Theory]])
- But, there are 4 patterns of... communication, conflict, something
### Pattern 1: Deferential-adaptive

### Pattern 2: Emotional conflict

### Pattern 3: Triangulation

### Pattern 4: Emotional distance

# How to change a system
### Ooh, Robert Gilman lecture! 
- From this great lecture "[Cultural Co-Evolver: Frameworks, Skillsets, & Strategy for Embodied Action w/ Robert Gilman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYQK8m_EZLc&t=2s)"
	- [Slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1m6--qRLMuGg1zmm4VKeQ3DkpO87YRRqb)
- He talks about this exact thing - how to be a "cultural co-evolver". Where, as a human, you are a node in the system of "culture", and you have some agency to change it. But you need to use systems thinking, rather than cause-and-effect/reductionist thinking
- Relevant slides:

- ðŸ‘‡ Improve the system by offering better paths forwards. Instead of "burn it all down", make old, maladaptive behaviours die out by offering alternatives, so the old ways become obsolete, because no one would intentionally choose a worse option. "Survival of the best ideas"
- ![[gilman-4.png]]
- "*You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.*" -R. Buckminster Fuller
#### Gilman's equation of change
- Gilman's equation of change, for changing a system.
1.  The perceived value of the new needs to be high
	- You have agency to boost this, via communication/marketing, and working on the new so that it's well thought out
2. The perceived value of the old needs to be trumped by the new
	- You can help this along by ensuring people understand that the "value of the old" isn't as high as the status quo might suggest
		- E.g., people may not realise how much the system is currently hurting some members of the system, because the members of the system may be hiding their pain
3. The perceived cost of the change needs to be low
	- You can help to reduced this cost my communicating well, doing a lot of planning re: implementation, shouldering as much of the work as possible yourself, etc
