# Intro of "Bowen Theory's Secrets: Revealing the Hidden Life of Families"
```
The first book I read on family systems was by
{{c1::Jenny Brown}}
|
Title of first book on family systems that I read
{{c1::Growing Yourself Up}}
|
The second book on family systems that I'm reading is called
{{c1::Bowen Theory's Secrets: Revealing the Hidden Life of Families}}
|
The second book on family systems that I'm reading is by
{{c1::Michael Kerr}}
|
Name of person who developed family systems theory:
{{c1::Murray Bowen}}
|
The title of the second book on family systems that I'm reading was influenced by the book:
{{c1::The Hidden Life of Trees}} 
|
Forester Peter Wohlleben describes trees as {{c1::social beings}} and {{c1::the forest as a social network}}, 
which is analogous to how Bowen theory views families
|
Re: family systems
The idea of {{c1::the family as an emotional unit}}
requires a radical and difficult shift in conceptual thinking 
away from 
{{c1::individualism}}
|
While others like 
Ludwig von Bertalanffy 
and Norbert Wiener 
{{c1::extended systems theories to human behaviour}},
Bowen was the first to 
{{c1::study the family in a live-in setting}}
|
Details of Bowen's NIMH Family Study Project 
{{c1::was a long-term study of families having one young adult member diagnosed with schizophrenia}}
|
Re: Bowen's NIMH Family Study Project, what researchers weren't limited to
{{c1::As they could observe family interactions directly, 
researchers were not limited to what family members said about their interactions}}
|
Bowen recognised that family processes could not be conceptualised using conventional {{c1::cause-and-effect}} thinking
|
Re: Bowen's family systems
Cause-and-effect thinking assumes 
{{c1::the principal cause of a person's symptoms resides within the person}}, 
AKA {{c1::individual psychopathology}}
|
John Bowlby's attachment theory, unlike Bowen's, 
{{c1::placed the problem within the person of the patient and invoked maternal deprivation as its prime cause}}
|
Re: family systems
Systems thinking is necessary to describe 
{{c1::the reciprocal interaction process 
where the individual and the family each affect the other}}
|
In Bowen theory, "self" refers specifically to 
{{c1::differentiation of self}}
distinguishing it from other conceptualisations
|
The uniqueness of Bowen theory's concept of "self" is 
{{c1::that it includes how individuals function in relationship systems}}
|
(Bowen)
Re: accurately assessing the robustness of a person's "self" 
{{c1::Can only occur in the context of their relationship environment}}
|
(Bowen)
"Self" continuum
{{c1::A person's capacity to maintain "self" at one end 
to their vulnerability to lose "self" at the other}}
|
(Bowen)
The pressure for oneness in families was termed "{{c1::stuck-togetherness}}" 
and later {{c1::the togetherness force}}
|
The counterbalancing force to togetherness is individuality, defined as a life growth force toward differentiation of self
{{c1::individuality}}
|
The intellectual system, enabled by the cerebral cortex, allows humans to use reason to exert some control over emotional system functioning
{{c1::intellectual system}}
|
Feelings are subjectively experienced via the cortex but reflect activity of the ancient subcortical circuits of the emotional system
{{c1::emotional system}}
|
A key outcome of the NIMH Family Study Project was a method of therapy for the family unit
{{c1::the family unit}}
|
Therapy helps people see the hidden processes of how they lose "self" in a relationship, providing a blueprint for change
{{c1::lose "self"}}
|
Unlike psychodynamic therapy, Bowen theory uses a systems lens to view current real-world interactions
{{c1::systems lens}}
|
Being an individual while closely involved with others enhances the stability and adaptive capacities of a relationship system
{{c1::stability and adaptive capacities}}
|
When people lose the ability to be an individual in a system, it becomes vulnerable to increased anxiety, which can fuel symptoms
{{c1::symptoms}}
|
A systems view shifts from "I am helpful because you are helpless" to seeing it as a reciprocal process: the more helpless you act, the more helpful I get, and vice versa
{{c1::reciprocal process}}
|
Blaming others and blaming oneself are the enemies of gaining a systems perspective
{{c1::Blaming others and blaming oneself}}
|
Translating a new way of thinking into a new way of being requires conviction and courage
{{c1::conviction and courage}}
|
A hallmark of a successful effort to define "self" is that it does not disrupt a relationship but instead solidifies it and fosters mutual respect
{{c1::solidifies it}}
|
Basic levels of differentiation of self are associated with people's ability to adapt to stressful life circumstances
{{c1::adapt to stressful life circumstances}}
|
Where people fall on the differentiation continuum reflects their ability to use their intellectual system to distinguish between feeling and intellectual processes
{{c1::feeling and intellectual processes}}
|
Being more differentiated is not about suppressing feelings but about using an intellectual process to gain objectivity and emotional neutrality
{{c1::objectivity and emotional neutrality}}
|
(Re: Bowen)
Research on chimpanzees who 
{{c1::could point to a lower number of treats only if it was shown via an abstract symbol}} 
suggests a parallel for 
{{c1::using a theoretical concept to override an emotional impulse}}
|
(Re: Bowen)
The chimps learned to 
{{c1::choose the smaller reward 
when the treats were replaced by affectively neutral symbols (numbers), 
allowing them to restrain their impulse}}
|
(Re: Bowen)
One person's ability to firmly maintain "self" in an anxious system 
(6 words)
{{c1::interrupts the infectious spread of anxiety}}
|
(Re: Bowen)
It is unnecessary and counterproductive to try to change others; 
{{c1::managing oneself well}} is sufficient to halt escalating chronic anxiety
|
|
Making Bowen theory one's own requires shifting completely from 
{{c1::cause-and-effect thinking}}
to 
{{c1::systems thinking}}

# Chapter 1
- I've already read about systems theory & some of Donella Meadow's "Thinking in Systems: A Primer", so already feel like I grok the basics
```
In Bowen theory, there are (count) {{c1::8}} "{{c1::interlocking concepts}}"
|
The statement 
"{{c1::I feel depressed because you would rather work in your garden than be with me}}" 
is an example of 
cause-and-effect thinking
|
Cause-and-effect thinking seeks to explain behaviour by asking what primary question?
{{c1::Why?}}
|
(Bowen)
Rather than asking "{{c1::why}}", 
Systems thinking tracks a relationship process by asking what four questions?
{{c1::How, what, when, and where}}
|
In systems thinking, 
A husband's depression and his wife's withdrawal are not cause and effect, 
but are seen as a...
{{c1::reciprocal emotional process}}
|
Within systems thinking, 
{{c2::the flow of emotions between people that mutually alters their internal states and actions }}
is termed the...
{{c1::emotional process}}
|
Why is blaming one's partner considered nonsensical from a systems thinking perspective?
{{c1::Because both people help create the changes in each other to which they then react}}
|
In systems thinking, 
Anxiety-driven interactions that can lead to abuse 
are understood as a {{c1::reciprocal process where each person plays a part}}, 
rather than a simple
{{c1::perpetrator-victim dynamic}}
|
The primary determinant for success in family therapy, 
is the ability of 
{{c1::at least one family member to shift from cause-and-effect thinking to systems thinking}}
|
The more a family system lacks differentiation of self, 
the more pronounced its
{{c1::action-reaction process}}
|
In Bowen theory, 
What is the core concept that describes an individual's capacity to balance their 
{{c2::Emotional and intellectual functioning}}?
{{c1::Differentiation of self}}
|
Re: drives
An individual with a low level of "self" is 
{{c1::More governed by their reactions to cues}}
|
How does Bowen's concept of 'triangles' fundamentally differ from Freud's 'Oedipus complex'?
{{c1::Bowen's is based on systems thinking 
Whereas Freud's is an extension of individual, cause-and-effect thinking}}
|
(According to Bowen theory)
The driving forces for {{c1::energy and activity}} within living systems, 
reside in the...
{{c1::emotional system}}
```
# Chapter 2
```
How does Bowen theory's use of the term "emotional system" differ from common usage?
{{c1::It is used more broadly, 
including the adaptive mechanisms of even simple organisms like bacteria}}
|
Why does Bowen theory take such an expanded, evolutionary view of the emotional system?
{{c1::To ensure the legacy 
of billions of years of evolution on the human emotional system 
is not overlooked}}
|
What metaphor is used by Michael Kerr
to describe the process of observing an emotional system?
{{c1::Studying the wind}}
|
How is observing a family's emotional system similar to observing the wind?
{{c1::You cannot see the system/wind itself, 
but you can infer its presence and force 
by its effects on visible things (family members/trees and sails)}}
|
The flow of invisible {{c1::emotional forces}} through a family, 
inferred by its impact on members, is referred to as the...
{{c1::emotional field}}
|
A young man who acts childishly 
only when visiting his parents, 
and blames them for it, is failing to see the...
{{c1::reciprocal process that he unwittingly helps create}}
|
Bowenian perspective re: problems from the past causing problems in the present?
{{c1::The past doesnt create problems in the present
The problems are actively re-created by the participants in the present}}
|
From a Bowenian perspective, relationship systems can be seen as extensions of the...
{{c1::emotional systems of individual brains}}
|
The Bowenian perspective that the relationship system 
is {{c1::an extension}} of the emotion brain
rhymes with the idea of
{{c1::The Extended Mind Thesis}}
|
Bowen states that
Automatic human behaviours, such as 
{{c1::distancing in the face of intensity}}, 
may have their roots in primitive mechanisms found in
single-celled organisms
|
According to neuroscience, 
the brain's emotional system is primarily located in the
{{c1::Subcortical}} part of the brain
|
Neuroscience:
The brain's emotional system is AKA the {{c1::limbic system}}
|
The core of Bowen theory's concept of "differentiation of self" 
relates to the brain's ability to distinguish between 
{{c1::Feeling and thinking}}
|
A person with higher differentiation of self 
is able to be informed by both 
{{c1::feeling}} and {{c1::thinking}} 
but can ultimately choose to act on
{{c1::thinking}}
|
Two key limiations of the "wind" metaphor for family emotional systems:
{{c1::1 - people in a system help generate the "emotional wind" through their reactions
2 - People have some choice over their reaction to the emotional process}}
