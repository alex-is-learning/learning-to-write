- I'm doing a deep read of this book:
- ![[Pasted image 20250717142358.png]]
- I have scribbled at various points in Michael Kerr's book on Bowen Family Systems theory  that the pedagogy of this theory is *trash*
	- Both Bowen's original terms, and some of the new ones from Kerr
- I can imagine writing a post about this, and coming up with a better-formulated theory
- It's mostly non-intuitive terms (e.g. "differentiation of self", where self is a very loaded word that should be avoided, and every time you read it you have to translate it into what they actually mean. See also Internal Family Systems, which also uses "Self" in a way that is deeply misleading and causes constant issues)
- Also confusing and misleading redundancy - there are two separate concepts, that Michael Kerr both calls "triangles". This is just... so fucking dumb. I've renamed the second to "triangulation"
- I think the problem here is the thing of "the pioneer should not also be the one to create the terms, you should find someone where cares about something like memetics, memetic fitness, pedagogy". 
	- A pioneer, and a map-maker
# This as a project
- I probably won't take "trying to improve the pedagogy/memetic fitness of Bowen family systems theory" up as an active project any time soon. But maybe I'll do it in the course of my own grokking of the theory, let's see
# What is bad?
## 1. "Differentiation of self" is a dreadful, misleading term
- Kerr says:
> *"Bowen theory's concept of differentiation of self is the most misunderstood of the eight concepts in the theory-probably also the most important."*
- I imagine it's the most misunderstood because it's confusingly named
- You can be someone who is reactive, and always immediately snaps, doesn't pause to consider more healthy options
- Or, you can be someone with more mindfulness, meta-cognition, the ability to pause, reflect on if the automatic, emotion-driven response is healthy, and rationally choose a more measured response
- This is a continuum, from "reactive, automatic, unreflective" to "reflective, measured, using the 'intellectual system' instead of just the 'emotional system' (cortex vs precortex)"
- And this is referred to as "differentiation of self" - what???
### Self is laden with meaning
- "Differentiation of self", intuitively to me, sounds like "developing your own personality/opinions", not "the ability to be less reactive and think things through more"
- The continuum is "can you use your rational side, your intellectual system, or not"
- IMO, it should be called, idk, "cortical functioning" or something
- Internal Family Systems does the same thing: "Self" means "a state of wholeness and presence, not a part, something bigger", but it sounds like "your true self", like "the healthiest part" or something. It's very *personalised*, evokes individuality, your true personality etc, where what it's actually pointing to is a place of wholeness
### I do get it, if I squint
- To have a more solid self = to have principles, to be grounded. And, instead of angrily snapping at someone, you may remain in the cortical, "intellectual" zone more, and choose a more measured response
- I think just the heavy echoes/connotations of "personality" when you say "self" mean you have this constant uphill battle, a constant "primary association" to fight off/unlearn. It's very annoying!
- "Differentiation of self"
	- It sounds like "developing your personality" or "becoming your own person"
	- When what they're pointing at is "become more mindful, less reaction, more rational"
## 2. "Triangle" is used to mean two different things
- Triangle vs triangulation (my term)
- Type 1 → "the triangle as the smallest *stable* relational group (that is, a group of 3 people)"
- Type 2 → triangulation, which is the process of a child being brought into the anxiety of the two parents. Only, Kerr doesn't call this triangulation, he calls it the triangle pattern. So when he talks about triangles, it's non-intuitive which he's talking about.
## 3. It has some great diagrams, but 
- It's missing meta-diagrams, diagrams showing the whole thing
- (admittedly, I haven't read the whole thing yet)
- Can I make these?
## 4. Classic non-fiction book thing of saying multiple times...
- "*This* is the most important thing"
- You can't have more than one "most important thing"! Which is it??
## 5. Being a book
- I think there are limits to the book format (v.s. e.g. a mnemonic medium). It needs far more diagrams, it needs definitions to be pulled out and formatted much more clearly, it needs far more clarity. E.g., this bit of text is batshit and would be so much better in a different format:
- ![[Pasted image 20250717142821.png]]
- "Fusion" isn't defined until ~40 pages later. The structure of the book is a mess.
## 6. Dominant-adaptive (deferential)
- Instead of "dominant-adaptive" being one of the 4 patterns of emotional function, Kerr's term is "dominant-adaptive (deferential)" - this is just more of a mouthful, harder to remember, redundant, stupid
## 7. Poor ordering 
- Uses terms (e.g. "fusion") for ~60 pages before finally defining them
## 8. Figure 5.3 is straight up wrong
- I had to draw my own on top to confirm - I swear to god, the actual graph implies that most people are 50/100 "differentiated", which is definitely not Kerr's point. It's supposed to be a graph with a long tail, but it's drawn to look essentially symmetrical. Am I missing something??

# Maybe it's anti-memetic because they haven't explained it well?
- From the intro to Kerr's book
> *"Despite Bowen theory being based on research begun more than seventy years ago, the value of viewing human beings as profoundly emotionally driven creatures and human families functioning as emotional units ==has yet to significantly penetrate the public consciousness==. Nor has the view of the forest as a social network penetrated the public consciousness. Both insights are secret, or at least largely hidden from view. This is obviously not the result of a conspiracy to suppress the information but, in the case of the family as an emotional unit, requires a radical and thus difficult shift in conceptual thinking. Most people acknowledge that the family is critically important to human health and well-being, but few are aware of the emotional forces and patterns of interaction in all families that govern whether the unit functions as a resource or stressor for its members."*
## Vs Internal Family Systems
- IFS has become pretty popular
- I wonder how much of this is downstream of having a core metaphor: "you have a lil family of 'parts' inside of you", which is very "sticky"/self-describing
- Vs, Bowen theory feels like much more of a mess
- The "wind" analogy from Kerr is pretty good, but somehow not as compelling
- Is Bowen theory just more nuanced and complex, harder to distill?
	- E.g., the idea of a "tree book", vs IFS as akin to a "branch book", that can be essentially summarised in a single sentence? (From Common Cog's "[The Three Types of Books](https://commoncog.com/the-3-kinds-of-non-fiction-book/)")
- Is Bowen theory a "hard to grok" mess intrinsically, due to complexity, or is Kerr just not a good teacher/theoretician?
