- Parent page â†’ [[ðŸŸ£ Learning how to think]]
- (*This page has a lot of overlap with [[03. Manifesto - "Why I Should Learn the Socratic Method"]], but the aim is to make it more systematic and thorough, rather than a top-of-mind brain dump*)

- Ok, so we saw in [[06. Learning the Socratic method, part 1 â†’ the rationale]] *why* it's profound
	- Cure you delusions of wisdom! (Double ignorance)
	- Improve your thinking!
	- Become John Stuart Mill! 
- So, now what? What do I do?
- Perhaps before "what do I do", it's like "what am I aiming for"
- We've talked about the problem space (you're ignorant af, bro), what is the solution space? What does a well functioning mind look like?
	- If there's "the mind left to itself" (*intellectus sibi permissus*), is there a Latin phrase for the alternative?
## The opposite of "*Intellectus sibi permissus*"
- Gemini says:
- (My prompt: If there's "the mind left to itself" (*intellectus sibi permissus*), is there a Latin phrase for the alternative?)
- (Gemini text in <span class="text-blue">blue</span>):

- <span class="text-blue">Yes, the direct alternative in Francis Bacon's philosophy is **`Interpretatio Naturae`**, which means "the interpretation of nature."</span>
- <span class="text-blue">Bacon framed these two concepts as a direct contrast representing the old, flawed way of thinking versus his new, proposed scientific method.</span>
- <span class="text-blue">The contrast</span>
	- <span class="text-blue">**`Intellectus Sibi Permissus` (The Problem):** This is the mind left to itself. Bacon believed this state leads to what he called _Anticipatio Mentis_ ("Anticipation of the Mind"), where the mind rashly leaps to conclusions and imposes its own biased ideas onto the world without sufficient evidence.</span>
	- <span class="text-blue">**`Interpretatio Naturae` (The Solution):** This is the disciplined mind. Instead of anticipating, it patiently and systematically observes nature, gathers data through experiments, and cautiously derives conclusions from that evidence. It is the slow, careful process of letting nature reveal its truths to the observer.</span>

#### Consistency
- The key importance of intellectual consistency
	- "To Socrates, this is everything"
- Performing surgery on yourself, heroic state
- Ridiculousness audit
- Care of the psyche, the soul, vs confusion
- Why Socrates was obsessed with definitions (page 83)


## "Tied up by your own thinking"
- A key thing is that Socrates wouldn't *tell* people what to think â†’ he'd extract someone's own thinking, show how it is paradoxical, and kind of leave them there. A lot of the dialogues end with people leaving, lol, but I imagine they remain very much perplexed
- This is key because it ==involves the ego of the other person==. If Socrates were to tell me that what I think is wrong and I should think this other thing instead, I could just go "well whatever, he doesn't get it", and move on, learning nothing
- But, if he progresses entirely by coaxing stuff out of me that ==I fully endorse==, and then shows how this line of logical is paradoxical and doesn't work, then I will feel personally involved; he has shown that my own thinking is faulty
- This is where ==aporia== comes in (an impasse, the lack of a path forwards), and it feels very perplexing, and it's human nature to want to figure out a path forwards
- I've experienced Socratic coaching from a friend, and aporia does feel incredibly potent, bedevilling, frustrating. 
	- It creates a very salient open loop, in the same way that doing top-down learning, where you go "huh, ==Israel just stuck Iran==, I know nothing about Iran, let me make some predictions about it, I think there's a 60% chance Iran borders Israel", and now you want to know if you're right or not, and when you realise you were pretty damn wrong, that creates a very salient, ego-bruising learning. 
		- See e.g. [[Israel & Iran (session 1)]]
	- Aporia is the same way: "ugh, wtf, I'm so confused, I need to resolve this". It's actually very addictive, and pretty much guaranteed to create an open loop that you are very motivated to solve (at least in my experience!)
- Agreement

## The elenchus
- This is one of the classic "moves"
- Socrates would have you confirm that you believe something (X), and confirm that you believe something else (Y), and then show how these two are incompatible
- This creates ==aporia==, as you are now tied up by your own thinking, and are at an impasse

#### "The Socratic Function"/theory of change
- Profundity of adversarial thinking (page 49)
- The importance of (the claim of) ignorance
- What the author writes about "The Socratic Function"
- What is elenctic thinking?
	- Purgative elenchus
	- Defensive elenchus
	- Gathering knowledge via elenchus (Popper)
		- "Production of cumulative consistency"
		- First principles, strong priors, evolutionary epistemology
	- Performing surgery on yourself, heroic state
	- Ridiculousness audit
- Care of the psyche, the soul, vs confusion
- Why Socrates was obsessed with definitions (page 83)
### 2. Technique/"how to" 
- The use of concrete examples
- Systole, systolic
- Diastole, diastolic
- Platonic collection and division, diairesis, dialecticians
- Chapter on analogies
	- Also, the epagoge
- Chapter â†’ Socratic Rules for Dialogue
	- Seeking the truth (dialectic vs eristic)
	- People, not just claims
	- The priority of reason
	- Candor
	- The one-witness principle
	- Charity (steelman)
	- Offense
- Chapter on how to make first half of the elenchus
- Chapter on how to make the second half of the elenchus
#### Profundity of questions
- More on the profundity of questions ("We're at our keenest when we work on a question")
	- (Chapter 5)
	- Counters the bad habit of a love of holding opinions
	- Turns you into a scientist
#### Aporia
- Even in a state of aporia, some things remain obvious ("I still know that I have only 2 hands")
- Aporetic cleansing
- Aporetic cleansing before learning
- The aporetic spur (so good!!!)
	- A salient, bedevilling open loop
	- Vs if you have double ignorance, certainty, then no curiosity, no open loop. Hedgehog (vs fog)
- Aporia, the ineffable, the Dao etc (page 134)
- False aporia is still useful
