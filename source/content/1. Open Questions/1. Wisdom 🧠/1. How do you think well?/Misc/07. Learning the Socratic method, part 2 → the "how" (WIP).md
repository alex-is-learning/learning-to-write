- Parent page â†’ [[ðŸŸ£ Learning how to think]]
- (*This page has a lot of overlap with [[03. Manifesto - "Why I Should Learn the Socratic Method"]], but the aim is to make it more systematic and thorough, rather than a top-of-mind brain dump*)
---
- Ok, so we saw in [[06. Learning the Socratic method, part 1 â†’ the rationale]] *why* it's profound
	- Cure you delusions of wisdom! (Double ignorance)
	- Improve your thinking!
	- Become John Stuart Mill! 
- So, now what? What do I do?
- Perhaps before "what do I do", it's like "what am I aiming for"
- We've talked about the problem space (you're ignorant af, bro), what is the solution space? What does a well functioning mind look like? What am I aiming for?
	- If there's "the mind left to itself" (*intellectus sibi permissus*), is there a Latin phrase for the alternative?
# 1. What does success look like?
## 1a.  The disciplined mind
- (My prompt: If there's "the mind left to itself" (*intellectus sibi permissus*), is there a Latin phrase for the alternative?)
- Gemini text: 
	- Yes, the direct alternative in Francis Bacon's philosophy is **`Interpretatio Naturae`**, which means "the interpretation of nature."
	- Bacon framed these two concepts as a direct contrast representing the old, flawed way of thinking versus his new, proposed scientific method.
	- The contrast
		- **`Intellectus Sibi Permissus` (The Problem):** 
			- This is the mind left to itself. Bacon believed this state leads to what he called ==_Anticipatio Mentis_== ("Anticipation of the Mind"), where the mind rashly leaps to conclusions and imposes its own biased ideas onto the world without sufficient evidence.
		- **`Interpretatio Naturae` (The Solution):** 
			- This is the disciplined mind. Instead of anticipating, it patiently and systematically observes nature, gathers data through experiments, and cautiously derives conclusions from that evidence. It is the slow, careful process of letting nature reveal its truths to the observer.
- Ok shit, this rules! *Anticipatio Mentis* is the exact thing that has triggered me to start this project
	- I developed my values [[My goals, values as of January 2025]] â†’ useful, good stuff
	- BUT, as soon as I got them, I was like "ok, I guess this is the ground truth, I will commit myself to this now", with some niggling issues in the back of my mind ("I still haven't arrived at Effective Altruism in a first-principles way", for example)
## 1b. A consistent mind
- If you are inconsistent, then you are confused
	- "Being inconsistent means being wrong. You find yourself holding two beliefs that are (let us assume) in undeniable conflict; they can't both be right. That means you evidently believe something that is false, or your claim to believe them both is false"
	- "If someone shows that your views are in conflict with new information, you might doubt the data. When your beliefs are in conflict with each other, it's uncomfortable in a more direct way. You can't attack the author of the study."
- "He shows you that *you* think you're wrong" - rather than telling you that you're wrong, Socrates would show you (via the elenchus) that you claim to believe is inconsistent and paradoxical
	- "Socrates has hogtied them with cords fashioned by their own consent"
- The key importance of intellectual consistency
	- "To Socrates, this is everything"
- Performing surgery on yourself, heroic state
- Ridiculousness audit
- Care of the psyche, the soul, vs confusion
- Why Socrates was obsessed with definitions (page 83)
# 2. The technique(s)
## 1. Aporia
- Even in a state of aporia, some things remain obvious ("I still know that I have only 2 hands")

### Aporetic cleansing

### The aporetic spur
- The aporetic spur (so good!!!)
	- A salient, bedevilling open loop
	- Vs if you have double ignorance, certainty, then no curiosity, no open loop. Hedgehog (vs fog)

### Aporia and the Ineffable
- Aporia, the ineffable, the Dao etc (page 134)

### False aporia is still useful
- False aporia is still useful
## 2. The elenchus
- This is one of the classic "moves"
- Socrates would have you confirm that you believe something (X), and confirm that you believe something else (Y), and then show how these two are incompatible
- This creates ==aporia==, as you are now tied up by your own thinking, and are at an impasse
- What is elenctic thinking?
### Purgative elenchus

### Defensive elenchus

### First half of the elenchus

### Second half of the elenchus
## 3. "Moves"
### The use of concrete examples, and analogies

### Systole

### Diastole

### Platonic collection and division, diairesis, dialecticians

## "The Socratic Function"
### Adversarial thinking

## 4. Epagoge



# Appendix
## How to use the Socratic method with other people
- This is not my priority at all, but I still think it's important to note:
- A key thing is that Socrates wouldn't *tell* people what to think â†’ he'd extract someone's own thinking, show how it is paradoxical, and kind of leave them there. A lot of the dialogues end with people leaving, lol, but I imagine they remain very much perplexed
- This is key because it ==involves the ego of the other person==. If Socrates were to tell me that what I think is wrong and I should think this other thing instead, I could just go "well whatever, he doesn't get it", and move on, learning nothing
- But, if he progresses entirely by coaxing stuff out of me that ==I fully endorse==, and then shows how this line of logical is paradoxical and doesn't work, then I will feel personally involved; he has shown that my own thinking is faulty
- This is where ==aporia== comes in (an impasse, the lack of a path forwards), and it feels very perplexing, and it's human nature to want to figure out a path forwards
- I've experienced Socratic coaching from a friend, and aporia does feel incredibly potent, bedevilling, frustrating. 
	- It creates a very salient open loop, in the same way that doing top-down learning, where you go "huh, ==Israel just stuck Iran==, I know nothing about Iran, let me make some predictions about it, I think there's a 60% chance Iran borders Israel", and now you want to know if you're right or not, and when you realise you were pretty damn wrong, that creates a very salient, ego-bruising learning. 
		- See e.g. [[Israel & Iran (session 1)]]
	- Aporia is the same way: "ugh, wtf, I'm so confused, I need to resolve this". It's actually very addictive, and pretty much guaranteed to create an open loop that you are very motivated to solve (at least in my experience!)
- Agreement
