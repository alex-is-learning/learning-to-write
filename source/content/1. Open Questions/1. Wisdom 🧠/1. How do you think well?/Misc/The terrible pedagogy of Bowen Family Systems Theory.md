- I have scribbled at various points in Michael Kerr's book on Bowen Family Systems theory  that the pedagogy of this theory is *trash*
	- Both Bowen's original terms, and some of the new ones from Kerr
- I can imagine writing a post about this, and coming up with a better-formulated theory
- It's mostly non-intuitive terms (e.g. "differentiation of self", where self is a very loaded word that should be avoided, and every time you read it you have to translate it into what they actually mean. See also Internal Family Systems, which also uses "Self" in a way that is deeply misleading and causes constant issues)
- Also confusing and misleading redundancy - there are two separate concepts, that Michael Kerr both calls "triangles". This is just... so fucking dumb. I've renamed the second to "triangulation"
- I think the problem here is the thing of "the pioneer should not also be the one to create the terms, you should find someone where cares about something like memetics, memetic fitness, pedagogy". 
	- A pioneer, and a map-maker
# 1. "Differentiation of self" is a dreadful, misleading term

# Maybe it's anti-memetic because they haven't explained it well?
- From the intro to Kerr's book
> *"Despite Bowen theory being based on research begun more than seventy years ago, the value of viewing human beings as profoundly emotionally driven creatures and human families functioning as emotional units has yet to significantly penetrate the public consciousness. Nor has the view of the forest as a social network penetrated the public consciousness. Both insights are secret, or at least largely hidden from view. This is obviously not the result of a conspiracy to suppress the information but, in the case of the family as an emotional unit, requires a radical and thus difficult shift in conceptual thinking. Most people acknowledge that the family is critically important to human health and well-being, but few are aware of the emotional forces and patterns of interaction in all families that govern whether the unit functions as a resource or stressor for its members."*
