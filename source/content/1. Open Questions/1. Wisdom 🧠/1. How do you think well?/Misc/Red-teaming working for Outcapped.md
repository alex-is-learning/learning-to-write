- Part time role, 8 poms a day
# Cons of working for Outcapped
## 1. "It's not very EA"
> *"It's not an explicitly Effective Altruist-aligned org"*
- **Counterpoint** 
	- I turned down an interview at AISI because I just don't care intrinsically about AI safety, and I want something remote
- **Another counterpoint** 
	- I don't care about EA atm â†’ [[Questioning Effective Altruism]]
## 2. Opportunity cost
> *"Taking this role will preclude the ability to take other roles"*
- **Counterpoint 1: I haven't seen anything else that I'd miss out on**
	- I've been looking at 80,000 Hours job board and opportunity board for months and it's rare that something *ideal* comes up â†’ Longview and Kairos are the only two like, A-tier roles
- **Counterpoint 2: it's completely congruent with my current mission, so there'd be no loss**
	- I currently feel that I want to work on my family, continue learning how to think, and have a part time job, so this fits that nicely
	- See e.g. [[Questioning Effective Altruism]]
- Remote âœ… good pay âœ… part-time âœ…
### If I don't care about EA atm, what about pitching non-EA places?
- E.g., Headgum?
- I can keep thinking about this during a 3-month probation period w/ Outcapped
## 3. What do I want to do?
### 3a. Keep figuring out what I want to do â†’ live in the uncertainty
- A part-time, remote, contractor role is ideal for that
- "Learn to think, put out fires, make some money, go from there"
- "Live in the uncertainty"
### 3b. Get some career capital
- I know that I don't have quite enough experience on my CV for the roles I've been trying to get (e.g., Kairos)
- This will be more experience in the stuff I did at Alvea (and partially at Refract) â†’ I only have 1-2 years of solid stuff on my CV, so this is more of that
- Lack of experience on my CV is a bottleneck to getting roles, so, get more âœ…
### 3c. Working with CoS/COO-style founders
- I've been pursuing close-to-founder work (like helping Cate Hall, or being an ExA at Longview)
- This is that - I'd be a trusted team member, as I've worked with Rob before, he said I'd immediately take on stuff that other contractors wouldn't
	- Similar to working with Brent, but for a startup that is already making money & has clients
	- So, a kind of Refract-Alvea hybrid
- It's ops, which I had been saying I didn't want to do
	- Automation, systematisation, rather than e.g. strategy
	- But I mean, Longview ExA would have been a chunk of stuff that wasn't relevant (answering emails, calendar scheduling), in order to be close to Gavin & Simran, see how they operate
- ðŸš¨ So, I should make sure Rob knows about this
	- ðŸš¨ Writing up a model of what I'm looking for, what I'm hoping to get out of it
- ðŸš¨ Explicitly name "learning from a COO/CoS-type" as something that I'm after
- This is aligned with that 
- This is Rob's new business
- And it's helping other businesses with ops stuff
- ðŸš¨ Don't necessarily want to be just an automations/systems guy
	- ðŸš¨ Question for Rob - what might my AORs be? Because the "learn how to set up companies" sounds cool, but maybe the other contractors will do that kind of thing?
## 4. Eight poms a day is kind of a lot?
- That's the *majority* of my poms
- I have a hard limit of around 14 poms, but 12 is more typical
- If I do 12/day, 
	- then the job will take up 66% of my working day, leaving only 4 poms for other stuff
- If 14/day, 
	- then 57%, 6 poms for other stuff
- If 16/day, 
	- then 50%, 8 poms for other stuff
### Make sure I do it *second*?
- E.g., log on after noon, once I've already done my most important stuff
- I've had eras of getting up at 6 (or even 5!) and doing like 10 poms by noon. Could do a similar thing here. 
- Use my morning freshness on my own stuff, then, slightly depleted, do my work, where I have the boost of a tight feedback loop and concrete results, tight OODA loop, which I don't have for non-work projects
## 5. What if I were to move away?
- 8 poms me, 8 poms work, evening, sleep, is fine when I live here and have a simple life. What about elsewhere?
	- Well, it's part time hours for ~full time pay â†’ seems fine

PArt time for me = I'm actually working at the intensity of full-time, if not more, but getting to spend ~50% of my time (if I can find the energy) on my own stuff.
## 6. What about a full time job and more money for training and therapy and stuff
- Socrates pointed this out
## 7. Three month contract and keep thinking

## 8. Questions for Rob
- What systems would I build?
- First 1-3 months?
