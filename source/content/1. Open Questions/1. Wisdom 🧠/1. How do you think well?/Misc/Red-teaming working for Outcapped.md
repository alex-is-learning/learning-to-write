- Part time role, 8 poms a day
# Cons of working for Outcapped
## 1. "It's not very EA"
- E.g., instead of working at an AI org, it's doing ops for various orgs
- *However*, I turned down an interview at AISI because I just don't care intrinsically about AI safety, and I want something remote
- I don't care about EA → [[Questioning Effective Altruism]]
## 2. Opportunity cost
- I currently feel that I want to work on my family and have a part time job, so this
- Remote ✅ good pay ✅ part-time ✅
## 3. 8 poms a day is kind of a lot?
- That's the *majority* of my poms
- I have a hard limit of around 14 poms, but 12 is more typical
- If I do 12/day, then the job will take up 66% of my working day, leaving only 4 poms for other stuff
- If 14/day, then 57%, 6 poms for other stuff
- If 16/day, then 50%, 8 poms for other stuff
### Make sure I do it *second*?
- E.g., log on after noon, once I've already done my most important stuff
- I've had eras of getting up at 6 (or even 5!) and doing like 10 poms by noon. Could do a similar thing here. Use my morning freshness on my own stuff, then, slightly depleted, do my work, where I have the boost of a tight feedback loop and concrete results, tight OODA loop, which I don't have for non-work projects
## 4. Is it the right kind of work? 
- I've been pursuing close-to-founder work (like helping Cate Hall, or being an ExA at Longview)
- This is that - I'd be a trusted team member, as I've worked with Rob before, he said I'd immediately take on stuff that other contractors wouldn't
- It's ops, which I had been saying I didn't want to do
	- Automation, systematisation, rather than e.g. strategy
	- But I mean, Longview ExA would have been a chunk of stuff that wasn't relevant (answering emails, calendar scheduling), in order to be close to Gavin & Simran, see how they operate
### Remote = don't get to see how Rob operates

### Learn from Rob
- Explicitly name this as something that I'm after
## What if I were to move away?
8 poms me, 8 poms work, evening, sleep, is fine when I live here and have a simple life. What about elsewhere?

PArt time for me = I'm actually working at the intensity of full-time, if not more, but getting to spend ~50% of my time (if I can find the energy) on my own stuff.
