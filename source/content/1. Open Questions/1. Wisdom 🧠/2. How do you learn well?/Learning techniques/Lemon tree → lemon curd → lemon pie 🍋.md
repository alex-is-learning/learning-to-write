- A message to a friend re: substack and lemons, lol
	- *"There’s something kinda nice in that [previous message from friend] about writing as like attempting to grow a healthy lemon tree, where for a while you can only grow these like shitty shrivelled fruits, it takes a good long while before the fruits are very plump and juicy"*
	- *"And the raw lemon might be pretty sour so you have to mix in a bunch of sugar (e.g. using storytelling to make the key ideas more palatable/likely to be consumed)"*
	- *"You pluck a healthy lemon and are like “I’m really pleased with this lemon how it is, but I know I’m gonna need to sweeten it into a curd or something to make other people want it”*
	- *"My ==public notebook as a load of raw lemons== vs substack as the place to make the curd, and maybe one day I’ll make a lemon meringue pie 🥧"*

- ☝️ my friend Simmo's lemon photo with the message "fallen lemons 💛" that spurred this idea (someone else replied to "fallen lemons" with "New substack title")
