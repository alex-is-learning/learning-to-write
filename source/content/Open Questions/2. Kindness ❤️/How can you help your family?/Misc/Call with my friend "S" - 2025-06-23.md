- What's your ultimate goal, the reason you want to make a presentation and show it to your mum?
	- The ultimate goal is to get the info to your mum
- Problem is - she’s not in a good place to hear it 
	- Shuts down at unsolicited advice
- 🚨So the thing you wanna do is not try to give her advice🚨
- The thing to do is - try to create an opportunity where she’d actually **like** to hear it 
- Basically, you just have to be a supportive listener with no agenda, until she indicates that this is somehting she’s struggling with an would like to talk about 
- You already feel tension about trying to push it on her. This is correct and reasonable. The actual answer is an extraordinary amount of patience and not trying to push her
## My message
- So I think “I’m going to join the gym next week and swim every week, you’re welcome to come!” is a good move here? 
- An invitation, no pressure
- We live a ~5 minute walk from a swimming pool/gym (me and my mum, that is)
- Normally we watch 1-2 hours of TV a night (which I don’t really want to do, my screen time is already so high) - it’d be great to switch to exercising together, I’d much prefer that, not just from a “you need to exercise more, mum!” place but a “I really don’t want to spend my evenings watching TV when I’m spending so much time at my computer already”
## Their answer
- Not quite what I said; sounds like from what you said, she’d experience it as pressure
