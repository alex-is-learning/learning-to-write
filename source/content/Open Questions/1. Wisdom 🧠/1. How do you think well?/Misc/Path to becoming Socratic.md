- So, I wrote up my model of the Socratic method, after reading the book ([[Model of the Socratic method, 2025-07-04]])
- What next?
# Stuff I don't remember/don't know, yet
- Looking at my notes in the margins, and anywhere where I've e.g. done a big exclamation mark
- ![[annotated-socrates.jpg]]
	- *That's right, teenage me, I'm not afraid to scribble all over a book*

## Flicking through the book to surface things that I didn't know that I don't know:
### 1. On the profundity/rationale/theory of change
#### Popularity
- John Stuart Mill quotes re: Socrates
- Author's thoughts on why the Socratic method isn't popular
#### Confusion
- Stuff about *confusion* being a key focus
	- Mill: "The Socratic method, of which the Platonic dialogues are the chief example, is unsurpassed as a discipline for correcting the errors, and clearing up the confusions incident to the *intellectus sibi permissus*, the understanding which has made up all its bundles of associations under the guidance of popular phraseology" (page 19)
	- *Intellectus sibi permissus* means "the mind left to itself"
	- Commonplace as being the key enemy, rather than Sophistry
- The key importance of intellectual consistency
	- "To Socrates, this is everything"
#### Profundity of questions
- More on the profundity of questions ("We're at our keenest when we work on a question")
	- (Chapter 5)
	- Counters the bad habit of a love of holding opinions
	- Turns you into a scientist
#### "The Socratic Function"/theory of change

#### Aporia
- Even in a state of aporia, some things remain obvious ("I still know that I have only 2 hands")
- Aporetic cleansing
- Aporetic cleansing before learning
- The aporetic spur (so good!!!)
	- A salient, bedevilling open loop
	- Vs if you have double ignorance, certainty, then no curiosity, no open loop. Hedgehog (vs fog)
- Aporia, the ineffable, the Dao etc (page 134)
- False aporia is still useful
#### Ignorance and midwifery
- Chapter about ignorance
	- Also, Buddhist moha
	- Conceits, like weeds, that block the growth of anything better
	- Irony
	- Ignorance of ignorance (double ignorance)
> "Socratic philosophy starts with a love of truth, but as a matter of *action* its first task is negative: shaking off the delusion of wisdom"
- Midwifery
	- Joe Hudson using VIEW to be the ideal midwife?
#### Socratic goods, ethics
- Socratic goods
	- *Ignoti nulla cupido* - this is a very profound thing to deeply grok!!!! (page 140)

- Socratic injuries (page 147 onwards)
	- If Socrates were to watch you
- Side note, it's time for me to finally learn - what is an analogy, what is a metaphor?
	- I'd also like to be better at punctuation â†’ I use the "â†’" a lot because I don't know which actual punctuation mark to use, smh
- Socratic ethics
	- Eudaimonia is the final goal
	- "Happiness" is a good translation, if you understand the Greek version of this
	- Socratic equation
		- Happiness = virtue = knowledge
	- The impossibility of akrasia
	- Lack of need for willpower re: e.g. "resisting" heroin
	- Everyone desires good things, no one willingly does wrong
		- "They're in the grip of mistakes and bad understandings" (and so are you!!!)

- Enneagram 3 and Socratic method (e.g. identity/image consciousness)
- Chapter on Socrates and the Stoics, and chapter on Socrates and the Skeptics â†’ don't care about this atm 
- Properly grok the different things that rhyme with the Socratic method and why (e.g., AoA's VIEW, and each of the 4 parts)
# ðŸš¨ Ok, now what? ðŸš¨
- I think I want to have a decent grokking of each of these headings
- Start with section 1 to grok the profundity & keep the motivation high (although admittedly it's already high)

	- Popularity
	- Confusion
	- Profundity of questions
	- "The Socratic Function"/theory of change
	- Aporia
	- Ignorance and midwifery
	- Socratic goods, ethics
## 01. Why isn't the Socratic method more popular?
- John Stuart Mill quotes re: Socrates
- Author's thoughts on why the Socratic method isn't popular

- My initial answer is that this is pretty straight-forward: it isn't popular because it's painful
- The author talks about how 
	- You know what, it's time to learn his name. He's very worthy of respect - this book rules, and he's written other books that look awesome. And he was the Dean of a law school I think?
	- Ward Farnsworth
```
The author of "The Socratic Method: A practitioner's guide"
{{c1::Ward Farnsworth}}
```
- Ok so yes, he talks about how the method doesn't promise to make us rich etc. And it's a rare philosophy that doesn't offer answers, just questions. So that's kind of off-putting at first glance
- Also, Socrates is kind of a pain, and it may not be obvious that we would want to be like him
- But also, there's this Latin phrase that I was very excited about, let me find it...
