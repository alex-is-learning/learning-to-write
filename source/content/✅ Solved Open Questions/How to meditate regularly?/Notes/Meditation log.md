## Week of 4th August
- Wed 2025-08-06
- Tue 2025-08-05
	- Left it too late! 
		- Did 30 minutes from 23:30, intending to do an hour, but started to fall asleep during the sit
		- Goodbye to my 9 day streak! But it's no worries. Back on the horse tomorrow, at an earlier time 🙏
- Mon 2025-08-04

	- [[2025-07-22 meditation open questions]]
- Mon 2025-07-21
	- [[Sit 000 report]] → 20 mins, 08:15
	- 10:00, did 10 mins → won't make a report because it was short
	- 23:00, did ~13 mins → super distracted
		- This is the hardest part of the journey! Super distracted, no clear benefits, feel like I'm failing. But it's ok, it's normal to have very poor shamatha at the start
## Week of 14th July
- Sun 2025-07-20
	- Wrote up [[Should I meditate regularly?]] → 4 pomodoros
	- Convinced myself!
	- Sit 1 → 30 minutes, focus on the nostrils
		- [[Ānāpānasati (Anapanasati)]]
	- Sit 2 → 20 minutes, nostrils
		- Very distracted in both of today's sits, of course. But came back to the breath a fair amount
