- [[Should I meditate regularly?]]
## Week for 28th July
- Wed 2025-07-30
	- [[Sit 004 report]] → 1 hour, with timelapse
- Tue 2025-07-29
	- [[Sit 003 report]] → 1 hour, with timelapse
- Mon 2025-07-28
	- [[Sit 002 report]] → 1 hour, with timelapse
## Week of 21st July 
- Sun 2025-07-27
	- [[Sit 001 report]] → 1 hour, with timelapse (lol)
	- And later on - a 15 min sit just before bed
- Tue 2025-07-22
	- 20 min sit, 09:00
	- 99% distracted, but came back to nostrils at least 6 times, even if only for a few seconds 😅
	- [[2025-07-22 meditation open questions]]
- Mon 2025-07-21
	- [[Sit 000 report]] → 20 mins, 08:15
	- 10:00, did 10 mins → won't make a report because it was short
	- 23:00, did ~13 mins → super distracted
		- This is the hardest part of the journey! Super distracted, no clear benefits, feel like I'm failing. But it's ok, it's normal to have very poor shamatha at the start
## Week of 14th July
- Sun 2025-07-20
	- Wrote up [[Should I meditate regularly?]] → 4 pomodoros
	- Convinced myself!
	- Sit 1 → 30 minutes, focus on the nostrils
		- [[Ānāpānasati (Anapanasati)]]
	- Sit 2 → 20 minutes, nostrils
		- Very distracted in both of today's sits, of course. But came back to the breath a fair amount
