- *Quick writeup:*
- I first got into this question during something like my third year of uni when I realised how bad I was at learning and how I forgot essentially everything from my lectures within 6 months
- I did the "Learning how to Learn" coursera course and that set me on the meta-learning path
- Anki flashcards
- Made this website, posted it to EA forum, offered free learning coaching, got job at Alvea
