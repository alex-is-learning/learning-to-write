- When you follow the Quartz guide:
	- [[How to create an Obsidian + Quartz website]]
- It'll involve downloading a ready-made Obsidian vault from Github
## Retaining your docs
- So, if you've already been writing in Obsidian, and now want to publish it via Quartz, you'll need to copy the markdown files from your "main" vault, into this new Quartz vault
	- Just copy-paste the files into the "content" folder
## And, if you want to keep your settings, theme etc
- Use this guide:
	- [[Making a second Obsidian Vault (and retaining your settings, hotkeys, etc)]]
