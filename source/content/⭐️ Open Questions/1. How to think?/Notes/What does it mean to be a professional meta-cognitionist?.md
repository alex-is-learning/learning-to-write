# 1. Experiences
## Why I'm thinking about this 
### Professionally confused at Outcapped
- Recently I've started working at an early-stage startup ([Outcapped](https://www.outcapped.com/))
- When I was last dropped into an early-stage startup ([Refract)](https://www.refract.space/), I was still essentially Kegan 3 (that is, not an adult yet) - just happy to be there, un-opinionated, "I'll just defer to the founder", etc
	- [[The Kegan 3 to Kegan 4 transition]]
- Vs here, I have a more clear sense of "oh, my confusion is useful, and everything hasn't been figured out yet, so I can help with the figuring out, and I can help future people who are onboarded", etc 
	- Also, my resistance is useful (e.g., to certain tasks or systems), and should be considered as useful signal
		- E.g. [[â€œ'Handle your feelings about the task' is the zeroth item on any todo list"]]
- So, rather than doing a bunch of concrete deliverables, I've mostly been interfacing with my own confusion and lack of understanding
- My model of the company has been poor, and knowledge transfer is never straightforward, as it's an early stage startup where a) documentation is nascent and b) things haven't been fully figured out anyway 
### Why isn't knowledge transfer straightforward?
- Even if someone has made an awesome, info-dense thing in say Notion, like a really useful table with an overview of stuff... IMO unless you're a genius, you can't just read that and have it click into place in your brain[^1]
- Re: Michelene Chi's "ICAP" model - you need to do some kind of active learning, to properly parse/grok the thing
	- [[Visual notes are a form of active learning]]
- Similarly - you can't just be told about a company strategy and have it click into your brain. You can't just attend a meeting and have everything click into your brain
	- [[Why doesn't transmissionism work?]]
# I was once hired as "head of shared knowledge"
- I care a lot about learning and I guess (as jargon-y as it now sounds to me) "knowledge management"
## Salient examples of knowledge management
1. A new person is onboarded: can they get oriented quickly?
2. Can the company strategy be easily red-teamed, or is the strategy mostly in the founder's head?
3. Are meeting notes turned into genuinely useful artefacts? Are new insights folded into key documents and plans?
4. Is the short term strategy clear? Is it well thought out? How do you know?
5. Is everyone working on the highest-leverage stuff? (Here, you need knowledge of what will actually move the needle)
# Trying to get to the "why"
- (Epistemic status: tentative): It feels like I'm no longer good at doing tasks that are just given to me. I need to understand them and why they're important, why they're worth me spending my time on, vs other things. I feel less able to do "just trust me bro"-type stuff
- I'd much rather be involved in the meta-layer, figuring things out, than be handed deliverables. I feel like I'm not the guy for one-off deliverables
# Professional hermeneuticist
- Hermeneutics is all about "interpretation and understanding"
- I join a startup, I don't really understand anything, I iterate and progressively learn
- I create maps to help my own understanding, and share them with others at the company
- The maps allow us all to get a better shared understanding, to establish a "shared reality"
- The maps allow us to spot holes, gaps in the plan, things that don't make sense, are redundant, etc. 
# Professional meta-cognitionist
- *Meta-cogniser? Meta-cognizer?*
- I join a startup, I notice my thinking ("I don't understand x, my model of y is poor")
- I work on improving my models
- I share the results
- Basically the exact same thing as "professional hermeneuticist"
# "Head of Shared Knowledge" wasn't actually needed at Alvea
- I think a few things happened at Alvea
## Lack of skill
- I really knew nothing about org-wide knowledge management. I was hired because it's something I care a lot about, but suddenly it was hoped that I'd have good interventions for ~25 people in an org. I'd also never done e.g. customer research, never heard of Paul Graham, etc. Basically, I made lots of mistakes, early on
## Lack of need (?)
- This seems like it could be an illusion, downstream of my lack of skill, but still...
- The org chart was essentially a few small teams - science team A and B, leadership, manufacturing, etc
- It felt like each subteam member was already an expert, could easily interface with other team members, the shared knowledge could exist in their heads, etc
- They didn't need a solution, really, IMO. "Help with knowledge management" actually really a node in their problem-space
# Systems are good for a professional meta-cogniser
- I ended up being a "process improvement specialist" at Alvea, and I think this was a great middle ground
- It basically involved doing basic customer research, where internal employees were the customers. What is their problem space? Get a good understanding of a problem, then solve it 
# Aren't all ops people meta-cognisers in that case, then?
- Knowledge management, learning, and communication/map-making feel like my particular edges, passion
- And I think, compared to other ops people, I am unusually averse to one-off, ad-hoc tasks. The kinds of things that don't cumulate/compound, that can be done by anyone
- There's a sense that a different ops team member could probably do a better, faster job than me at one-off tasks, and I'd rather be doing the stuff that is unusual to me - the map-making, to clarity-mining, etc
# Feedback I've received re: this
- Feedback from Ethan, co-CEO of Alvea, re: "`Lucidity (mental clarity, ability to make things clear and structured)`":
	- "Impressive ability to crystallise, structure and organise information"
	- "Historically you haven't celebrated this enough"
	- "Sounds like you think it's easy to do this and therefore replace-able, not valuable"
	- "Counter-example: the surprise I felt after we had a few conversations re: [topic] and you turned it into something very legible, crystallised it"
	- Even has a guy currently working on this with 25 years experience and doesn't seem to be able to do the job like I could, I would have grok-d more and put it in a more legible format
	- ==Therefore this isn't trivial and should be done more!==
	- "You ==blew my mind== a few times with our early collaborations, this was really valuable."

# How much do I actually need to understand?
## 1. As much as *I want*
- I personally want to understand as much as possible
- Like, I have an incentive (which might not align with the business!) to understand as much as I need to 
- A business might just be like "look, we don't need you to properly understand x, we just need you to do y thing"
- E.g., at Alvea, no one was like "we need you to understand the strategy", and I was actually content not knowing the strategy, because it was already well defined by a leadership team
- So, I think my current interest is downstream of wanting to be more of a help. Like, I think if I have a proper, high level, meta understanding of the business and plan, I'll be able to have better contributions. 
	- Vs a) I don't want to be "flying blind", just shipping deliverables without an understanding of what they're connected to
	- And b) just shipping the deliverables that I'm told to ship, rather than zooming out and double checking the meta-level model and strategy
		- It feels to me at Outcapped that there is room for manoeuvring re: "hey I know the plan is x, but what about x-v2"

[^1]: I imagine that if you're there to do straightforward deliverable stuff, then you don't *need* to grok the table fully. But I have a sense that, my whole kind of *way of being* at the moment is oriented around properly learning stuff. So, I don't want to be someone who just does the deliverables, without properly understanding the company
