- Super addicted to this, watched it a bunch of times today (I think the music video adds a lot to the song)

## Hypnotic
- I love how repetitive it is. There's a hypnotic quality that I find really compelling. The way on the chorus she sounds pretty much exactly the same 4 times, it feels like a chant to reassure herself,

> Can only go up from here
> Can only go up from here
> Can only go up from here
> Can only go up, can only go up

And then she repeats again but with this kind of unsettling new tone where she slides between the notes, I love it

But also, the verses are repetitive and hypnotic too

> I'll be the biggest star  
> At this racist country singer's bar  
> No use shooting for the moon  
> No use chasing waterfalls

> I'm the biggest star  
> At this racist country singer's bar  
> No use shooting for the moon  
> No use chasing waterfalls

Like, it's "repetitive, hypnotic verse x2, then repetitive, hypnotic verse x2"

Kinda reminds me of the final song on Fiona Apple's "Fetch The Bolt Cutters" where she repeats:

**Fiona:**

> On I go, not toward or away  
> Up until now it was day, next day  
> Up until now in a rush to prove  
> But now I only move to move

Many times, very "reassuring myself", meditative vibes
## High conviction artist
- I think she's really "high conviction" in the music video in a way that's super compelling. Like, no self awareness, total aura, total confidence

- *Ughhhh, I got nerd-sniped trying to add gifs here, tried making them and they were way too big* 
- Anyway, there's a scene where she's with someone who is clearly aware that he's on camera and he's trying to do a cool weird dance like her but is clearly very much in "am I doing it right" mode and this self-conscious like "looking out the corner of my eye at her, and also wearing this big smile that's a little forced to look like I'm comfortable and having fun", vs she's just totally in it and total conviction no eye movements just totally locked in

- Is "full conviction mode" the same as [[Max aura]] mode?
# Vs Wet Leg - lower conviction

- I love this btw - never listened to them before, CPR (song 1) is great but song 2 (Mangetout) is *so good* â†’ the band sound so tight, the group vocals ruleeee
