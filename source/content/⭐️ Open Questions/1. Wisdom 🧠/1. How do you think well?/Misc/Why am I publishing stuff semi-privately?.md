# 1. Bump from my friend Simmo
- I shared the following screenshot in my triad group chat and got a voice note reply from Simmo:
	- ![[Why am I publishing stuff semi-privately?.png]]
	- Voice note audio:
		- 
	- *"Awesome, Alex - yeah, I’m curious, why is that you’re ==publishing less publicly than substack?=="*
	- *"My sense is that at least a quarter of this stuff, somewhere between 25%-75% of the stuff you publish on your personal site, would be ==really good content== 
		- *it's quite ==unique==, it's really ==analytical==, it's very ==skilled== and shows people how to ==think==, as well as shows people the content of the stuff that you're ==learning==,* 
		- *and [redacted] and I often find it really valuable - even though we're much closer to you (maybe we're a target audience in the way because we know you), but I think there's a ==bigger target audience than you maybe realise=="*
	- *"I guess my value proposition is like*
		- *if it feels as ==frictionless== to post some of this stuff more publicly 
		- *you can build a ==following==, and you can build an extra ==revenue== stream ultimately if you build a following,*
		- *and my sense is that if you keep publishing as you are doing but more publicly, within a year you're gonna have loads of ==followers==, and clients, potential customers, you can monetise something, pretty much anything, probably wouldn't be much work."*
	- *"So I guess it's a curiosity about - I'm not sure what the reasoning is that you're doing everything semi-privately, and publishing very little in the more public domains of Substack etc"*
# 2. So yeah, what's up with that? 
- I'm no stranger to posting publicly, I don't have significant emotional blocks against it (I used to, and now they're all gone)
## 2a. Quick excursus on my previous emotional blocks
- *Because I love doing Alex Anthropology, lol*
	- [[Self-anthropology]]
- Also kinda inspired by [[Should I meditate regularly?]] yesterday, where I found it really useful (and fun) to gather all my previous experiences with meditation, before then tackling the "why am I not doing it right now, and should I?" question
### No emotional blocks, just a kid
#### 1. First ever youtube video - me as a ~10 year old playing the guitar
- Omg I totally forgot about this, lmao
- I remember being in my primary school uniform, and filming myself playing the "[Old Snake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k3n5me4Rns)" theme from Metal Gear Solid 4 on my classical guitar, right way back when when I couldn't actually play the guitar
- I remember an adult commenting on it like "you're not very good, are you", lmao
- Omg, me and my friend at primary school also made videos of us skateboarding, this also just came back to me. I remember editing them on Windows Movie Maker at school and showing them to our class, lmao. Probably with Green Day as the backing track. (We were shit at skateboarding, lol)
#### 2. Vlogging as a teenager
- I made maybe 3 vlogs as a teenager, and liked it. However, was definitely scary! I remember getting a few comments, and someone commenting like "hey, come back :(" when I stopped posting, which was cute
- One involved me on a walk during a rare snow day - I remember filming me opening the curtains and going "it's snowing!!", and filming myself making a snow angel, and then talking at the camera as I walked by the river
- It felt like a teenage experiment rather than something I was like, trying to do regularly
#### 3. Tweeting during school
- I tweeted loads during school, to essentially no one, lol
### Emotional blocks as an "adult"[^1]
#### 1. Being a tpot lurker
- I discovered the post-rationalist/tpot space (see [[Should I meditate regularly?]])
	- [[Tpot, post-rationalism]]
- Around the age of 26
- But I was a lurker for a good long while - for whatever reason I didn't want to tweet
- I think lurker-ism comes down to:
	- Feeling like a nobody
	- Feeling like you don't have anything "interesting" to say. Unlike the "big accounts" that you follow, who have an established POV, a feedback loop, etc, you're just some random dude
##### Vipassana retreat → insight
- During my 10 day retreat, I had the update of "oh, I want to have creative expression, I want to have a voice"
##### Tweeting way more, and starting a substack
- So, after the retreat, I started tweeting a bunch
- I quickly made some nice "mutuals" (people who, you reply to their stuff, they reply to your stuff, now you're friends and support each other)
- Twitter with mutuals immediately feels wayyyy better. From "tweeting into the void" to "tweeting to my 5-20 people who I interact with ~daily"
- I also made a Substack
	- First post, "[Paper journaling is better, actually*](https://alexislearning.substack.com/p/paper-journaling-is-better-actually)" → because I did a bunch of paper journaling during the meditation retreat
		- This reminded me how much I love writing! 
		- I was always weirdly good at writing, like at school I was (if I do say so myself) the best in my class all the way up to A Level, and it was always just effortless somehow
			- There's a Sasha Chapin thing about "if you're wondering what you're talented at, just ask yourself 'what do you think other people are weirdly bad at'"
		- And also, look at me recording myself reading my first ever Substack post out loud, lol. I have a big "attention seeker" side. Call it being a Leo, or an Enneagram 3, or something. 
	- Then I wrote "[Consensus-ism (part 1)](https://alexislearning.substack.com/p/consensus-ism-part-1)" (400 views, nice!), "[My 10-day silent meditation retreat didn't work*](https://alexislearning.substack.com/p/my-10-day-silent-meditation-retreat)", "[The meditation retreat _was_ working](https://alexislearning.substack.com/p/the-meditation-retreat-_was_-working)"
- Sadly this twitter account eventually got suspended because they thought I was a bot, I think because I was using a VPN and working from public library wifi in Toronto
- [Substack about this](https://alexislearning.substack.com/p/i-got-suspended-from-twitter-and)
### 2. Youtube as an adult
#### Attempting to appear in videos with Simmo
- Me and Simmo worked on a youtube channel in Asia for a little bit
- I tried recording myself for one video and I was just so stilted and awkward lol, it was a total no go
#### ~Stream entry to the rescue
- I had my ~stream entry experience (see [[Should I meditate regularly?]])
- And then immediately, my adult fear of being in front of the camera dropped to 0, as I no longer had social anxiety
- Made a vlog of me at Life Itself in France (where I was living at the time) and was just totally chill
#### Making music/vlogs - "Alex is Creating Things (Finally!)"
- [Tada](https://www.youtube.com/@alexiscreatingthings)! (Youtube channel)
- I realised that I wanted to try making music and vlogs
- There was an initial block of like "oh god, but I'm shit at music"
- Also "oh god, it's cringe to make a video that only gets like 20 views"
- However, it quickly became very enjoyable. I think once I pulled the trigger and made the first video, I ended up publishing like 3 in the first day, and then a bunch for the next few weeks
- Post-stream entry, so being in front of a camera felt totally fine
- And I got comments pretty quickly! So that was great
- It felt kind of cringe posting from a place of low status ("I've moved back in with my mum and I don't know what I'm doing with my life!"), but there was a much stronger feeling of (1) pride (2) excitement (this rules, I couldn't do this before, this feels so easy!) (3) creative expression
- I stopped posting when my "oh yes, I definitely want to make music, that's my 'thing'" story stopped feeling true (which kind of happened because I got my first ever "fan email" and was like "huh, this is kinda nice, but... idk if I care anymore?")
## 2b. Current emotional blocks

[^1]: I say "adult" because I don't know if I can really call myself an adult yet. I think I'm getting there, and have made a bunch of progress in the last ~2 years. I think maybe currently in the painful "Kegan stage 3 to Kegan stage 4" transition.
