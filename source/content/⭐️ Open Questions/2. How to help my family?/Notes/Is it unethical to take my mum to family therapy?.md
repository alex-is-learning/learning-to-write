- I've had this thought in my head since session 1 (session 2 is supposed to be next week, but I'm currently unsure if I should go ahead with it)
- Below are some scrappy thoughts
# 1. Who am I to prescribe anything?
- This was one thread in the discussion during the in-person family therapy session. There are a few things here:
## 1a. Who am I to tell someone how to live?
- In many ways, I am a deeply naive and clueless person. I pivot constantly, I lack a coherent worldview, I lack good epistemics, I'm at the very beginning of figuring anything out. I've been feeling recently like I'm now roughly a Kegan 4, as of... maybe a few months ago, if that. So, in a way, I've been almost-an-adult, for a few months (I say "almost" because I feel like, maybe a Kegan 3.8, or something). So, how insane to think that I can drag someone to family therapy because I think they should live according to my prescriptions?
	- [[The Kegan 3 to Kegan 4 transition]]
## 1b. Who says I'm right?
- Similar to above point, but I think p(a year from now I think I was totally in the wrong re: my worldview, my plans, etc) is *very* high. I think I'll think "totally makes sense that 29 year old Alex felt that way, and his heart was absolutely in the right place, but oh my god, the youthful arrogance"
- 40 year old Alex: "remember that time when I was about to turn 29 and I thought I should drag my mum to family therapy to get her to 'wake up' and change, whilst I was personally barely an adult and still had a huge amount of personal waking up/cleaning up/showing up to do? Why the hell did I choose that time to try to change *someone else*? Ultimately, because I was hoping it'd give me more peace of mind. I felt like I'd never be able to 'move on' whilst my family members were suffering (even if mostly unbeknownst to them)"
## 1c. Is it ethical to say terrible things to someone?
- If you are deeply judgemental about someone, should you tell them your judgemental thoughts? Or should you keep them to yourself? Are they useful data points for them to understand how they hurt you, that might help them to change? Or are they deeply hurtful things that they'll never be able to unhear, and will reinforce their default state of being which involves repressing difficult truths?
## 1d. Is my prescription remotely possible?

- https://x.com/sashachapin/status/1865558631405752393
- My prescription to each family member is: "stop lying to yourself, face how unsatisfactory your life is, face it now, before it's too late, I don't want you to face it on your death bed and be filled with regret for what could have been"
- But - who am I to prescribe such a thing? It's a very painful thing to do
- "You should do psychedelics, deeply feel into the profound pain that you've been avoiding, do a 2 year healing journey"
- "How do I 'help' my family" → 
	- "by waking them up to their cowardice and avoidance and shadow, and finally make profound changes to hugely improve their quality of life" 
	- "by being kinder to them and loving them"
- This also reminds me of the Simone Weil quote
	- This sequence reveals a profound connection between her lived experience and her
	developing metaphysics. Her later philosophy would posit that divine grace "==can only enter where there is a void to receive it==". → who am I to try to induce the creation of the void?
## 1e. The curse of knowledge
- There's something here around → I've spend ~2-3 difficult, stumbling years trying to make progress in the "healing" space. I had a series of lucky breaks, circumstantial and constitutional luck. I don't have a simple formula that I can prescribe. But, because I've made progress, I'm like "you've got to try, it's worth it, and you'll get there!". But my progress isn't even apparent to my family, and I don't have a clear path to prescribe to them, other than... "face your pain, increase your self awareness, get involved in the community", which, is anyone going to do that when they're in their 60s? 
# 2. Who am I to judge?
## 2a. Being angry at family members for human nature
### Ignorance
- Ignorance is one of the 3 Buddhist defilements. 
- I'm still probably like 99.99% ignorant. 
- And of course, Socratic ignorance too, which he believed to be the worst thing of all 
	- (false belief that you have wisdom, so you're ignorant or your ignorance, double ignorance)
### Aversion
- And aversion is another of the 3 Buddhist defilements. 
- Wincing away from painful things is a built-in part of the natural human brain, it's something that is very difficult to overcome
- Wincing away from the idea of trying to improve your life. Learned helplessness. Overwhelm, intractability
### Craving
- Craving easy pleasures, easy escapes. Comfort eating, comedy podcasts, entertainment.
## 2b. Avoidance and ignorance is built into our culture
- Alienation of modernism & post-modernism. Atomisation, the breakdown of community, of the family. Consumer society, neoliberalism, the "consumer class" rather than the Keynsian post-war consensus. Being a "consumer", not a citizen. The death of religion. Lack of role models, coming from broken homes. Being kegan 3. Education that never teaches you how to think
### Infinite Jest and entertainment
- I think that each family member is, in a very profound way, totally wasting their years
- However, the ease of distraction (e.g., watching 4 hours of TV every evening) means that this can be kept at bay
- (See also "Amusing Ourselves to Death")

### From "This is Water"

> But the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they’re evil or sinful, it’s that they’re ==unconscious==. They are default settings.

> They’re the kind of worship you just gradually slip into, day after day, getting more and more selective about what you see and how you measure value without ever being fully aware that that’s what you’re doing.

> ==And the so-called real world will not discourage you from operating on your default settings==, because the so-called real world of men and money and power ==hums merrily along in a pool of fear and anger and frustration and craving and worship of self==. 

> Our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom. ==The freedom all to be lords of our tiny skull-sized kingdoms==, alone at the centre of all creation. 
### Let he is does not amuse himself to death cast the first stone
- For the past 2+ years I have listened to 3+ hours of comedy podcasts per day, because to go on a walk, to do the dishes, to brush my teeth etc with no entertainment would be a waste of precious time that I could spend with my parasocial besties
- If I refused to have parasocial "friends", it's likely I'd have much more energy for messaging my real friends 
### From the "The deliberate demoralisation of the masses" section of Bonesaw's "[Craniotomy](https://bonesawmd.substack.com/p/craniotomy-dissection-of-your-human)":

>This systematic reduction of your existence to a statistic gradually erodes your sense of agency—the belief that your choices and actions can meaningfully shape your world. In this diminished state, summoning the desire to transcend mere survival becomes extraordinarily difficult; this pervasive atmosphere of collective resignation anchors your spirit into dirt.

- It's wild how de-agentified we are by society, to the point where "you can do things" is a radical idea
	- This has got to such a point that "you can just do things" is a "radical" meme in the tpot scene, and people over there are constantly banging the drum of agency. You can do things! You can do things! This is something you learn as an adult, if you have the requisite [[Circumstantial luck]], if you meet awake people who are aligned with the Good
	- A similar thing here → [[ORI idea - the universe (you're a cell inside an organism)]] → "the fact that you can ask for things and the universe will respond" is not woo, we're just in a collective organism of humans"
	- Also dead internet theory, and the extension of [dead planet theory](https://arealsociety.substack.com/p/the-dead-planet-theory?utm_campaign=post), how "no one does anything"

>The entire system is designed to maintain your position, perpetually rotating on the hamster wheel—creating the illusion of progress through constant movement and scurrying, while ensuring you travel in perfect circles, forever approaching yet never arriving to any meaningful destination.

>Many people will live the same 6 months, over and over again without conscious knowledge.

>I speak of this with such disdain because this, among other things, contributes to the dissolution of our collective consciousness, our intellectual confusion, and an almost insurmountable angst in the general population.

>When stressed, distracted, and dispirited, it is distressingly easy for governing institutions to subject you to any circumstance—to dictate your thoughts and emotional states. The modern world has been engineered with a frightening precision to separate you from yourself.

>It compels you to abandon your aspirations and to forget what brings you joy and real life experience because you must always concern yourself with the immediate necessities required to survive.

>The only thing in this world that you can truly have control over is the thought faculty of your mind, and most have already surrendered this unknowingly.

### Simone Weil's concept of "affliction"
- *from Gemini*

For Weil, affliction is a state far more profound and devastating than mere suffering. While suffering can be physical or emotional pain, affliction is an ==uprooting of the soul==, a degradation that attacks a person's very being. It encompasses physical pain, social degradation, and psychological distress, creating a sense of absolute abandonment and personal worthlessness. A key distinction lies in its capacity to silence its victims, leaving them unable to articulate their experience.

Weil often described affliction as the "mark of slavery," a condition that robs an individual of their personality and reduces them to a mere object. This is not just a metaphor for physical bondage but extends to any situation where a human being is subjected to the blind, mechanical forces of necessity, whether in a factory, on a battlefield, or through social oppression. This experience of being a "thing" is what separates affliction from other forms of hardship.

According to Weil, affliction forces a confrontation with the brutal reality of necessity, the unchangeable and indifferent laws that govern the universe. In this state of extreme dereliction, God appears to be absent. This perceived absence is not a denial of God's existence but rather a fundamental aspect of the experience of affliction. It is in this void, this "dark night of the soul," that the possibility of a unique spiritual encounter arises.
### The introduction of the great essay "Craniotomy" that I'm reading today
- https://bonesawmd.substack.com/p/craniotomy-dissection-of-your-human

> After observing the behaviours and attitudes of the average person today, an observer needn’t spend much time before questioning themselves entirely. This spectacle: so absurd, so ridiculous, so strange, that it is more comforting to imagine that it is not society that we observe, but a zoo. An enclosure of some sort. The creatures inside of it, ==barely clinging on to their consciousness==. Online, this conclusion becomes more accurate:

> _Rodent is the rule; and vermin, an honest critique._

> Therefore: few will ever do it, ==there are so many clever ways that one avoids this honest confrontation==. Truthful acknowledgement of this fact—how far one falls from their potential—is always demoralising to the human character.

> On and on they go: ==despite this perpetual and endless cycle, they spin like gerbils endlessly==. As if by some miracle the wheel is one of fortune, and suddenly everything will change if they continue to spin the loop. It has been years; yet they spin it still.

> They say they wish to be great, or at the very least humbly fulfilled. Yet, their actions do not seem to align with their desires. ==An insurmountable chasm of paralysis and procrastination== exists between their intention and execution.

> ==How can they allow so many of their days to blur into each other?== Each year passes faster, and the months become the same, the days themselves now disappear. Repeated again and again. Repeated again and again.

# 3. Alternative paths
## This is Water
- Does David say that you should be angry with people and try to shake them out of their default mode and radically change? Or does he say that life is about learning to exercise control over how and what you think, to be conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to, and to choose how you extract meaning from experience?
	- AKA John Vervaeke's "perspectival" knowledge
	- AKA something that my ethics tutor talked about in my second lesson with him, excitingly enough
## Simone Weil's "attention"
- *From Gemini*

In Simone Weil's philosophy, "attention" is a concept of profound significance, extending far beyond its everyday meaning of focus or concentration. It is a central pillar of her ethical, spiritual, and educational thought, representing a particular way of being in the world that is both a moral act and a path to spiritual insight.

For Weil, attention is not a muscular effort or a straining of the will. Instead, she describes it as a "negative effort," a form of passive, open waiting. It involves suspending one's own thoughts and desires to ==become receptive to the reality of the other==, whether that other is a person, a mathematical problem, or God. This is a state of "unmixed attention," which she considered to be the same as prayer.

Weil famously wrote, "==Those who are unhappy have no need for anything in this world but people capable of giving them their attention." She believed that true attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity==. To attend to another person, especially one who is suffering, is to see them in their full humanity, beyond any labels or social categories. This act of seeing is an act of love and the very essence of justice. It requires emptying oneself of ego and preconceptions to truly receive the other person's reality.

Weil saw the development of the faculty of attention as the primary goal of education. She argued that school studies, even seemingly mundane ones like geometry, are valuable not for their practical application but for their ability to train the mind in this specific form of attention. The effort to solve a problem, even if unsuccessful, cultivates a "more mysterious dimension" of the soul, a capacity for a deeper, more patient form of looking that can then be applied to all aspects of life.

For Weil, the highest form of attention is prayer. When directed towards God, this receptive and waiting attitude allows the soul to be penetrated by divine grace. This is not about formulating requests or engaging in a dialogue, but about a silent, loving orientation of the soul towards God.

In a world increasingly characterized by distraction and a "for-or-against mentality," Weil's concept of attention offers a powerful antidote. ==It calls for a radical openness to reality, a willingness to be transformed by what one encounters, and a deep respect for the inherent worth of every individual==.
