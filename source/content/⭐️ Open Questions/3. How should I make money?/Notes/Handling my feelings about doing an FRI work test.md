- [[FRI (Parent Page)]]
- 2025-08-06
- So, I've made it past the initial application stage and have now been invited to do a paid 5-10 hour work trial
- I've taken the day off from my contractor job to do it the work trial (or at least, a big chunk of it)
- But, I'm feeling aversion!
- Then I remembered this banger tweet
	- ![[“'handle your feelings about the task' is the zeroth item on any todo list".png]]
	- [[“'Handle your feelings about the task' is the zeroth item on any todo list"]]
- So, here I am, to handle my feelings
- There are I'm sure very straightforward things leading to the aversion, that will resolve once brought to the light (or, will make a case for "don't do the work trial")
- So, the question is: should I do the work trial or not? 
# In favour of doing the work trial
## Money and stability
- As of the 28th of July → "[[I am now making money!]]"
- However, this is via a contractor operations-y role for an early stage startup, so there's no guarantees that I'll get paid indefinitely, no stability
- I'm also still figuring out how I feel about the role
- So overall, it doesn't feel like *enough* right now
- Also, I'm planning on moving to London soon, so it makes total sense to "income-stability-max", so that I can pay rent etc without dipping into my (mostly depleted from 2 years of post-rat journey) savings
## Potentially cool role
- I need to revisit it to see, but I remember convincing myself that it was worth applying to 
- Of course, being a part time research assistant is very different from being a member of Philip Tetlock's team. But it does get me closer to that world, which seems like it could be a good world to exist in
- [[Model of FRI]] & [[Why work for FRI]] & [[What actually is the FRI role?]]
# Resistance to doing the work trial
- There's initial resistance just because I don't know what it is yet
	- I imagine reading the instructions will make it feel less "daunting"
	- Ok, I've now looked at the work trial instructions
## I've never done anything like this before
- The work task looks *hard*
- ![[Handling my feelings about doing an FRI work test123.png]]
- It's about identifying cruxes in policy debates
- I've used Fatebook.io for a few months so I've got experience in forecasting (in a very low stakes way), but I've never thought about policy etc
- It could be the kind of thing that I can do, because ultimately it's just reasoning, being thorough etc, but my gut sense is "oh man, doing a *brand new thing* during a work trial does not bode well for my success"
- So, after reading the task document, my p(pass the work trial) has dropped
	- It's not like 0% chance I pass → maybe they're not looking for experts here (I mean, it's a part-time contractor role, not a full time employee position)
	- But then again, maybe I'll be competing with a bunch of LessWrongers/Metaculus users who do this kind of stuff all the time
- However, I do get paid either way 
	- $200, max of 10 hours of work 
	- That's £15
	- So, £15/hour pre-tax if I do the full 10 hours - pretty bad
	- But, £30/hour pre-tax if I do 5 hours
	- And get some experience in a new kind of work
	- Maybe I'll cap it at 5 hours of initial work today
# The work task seems like a great filter for "do I want this role"
- It could be the case that I *suck* at the work task, and I don't get to the next stage, and I'm like "yeah fair enough, that kind of work is just not for me"
- Or it could be that I actually do fairly well and this unlocks a new avenue of work for me
- So it does feel like there's good, positive, useful data to be gained from doing it (and it's paid too)
- Like, nothing to lose (apart from ~5-10 hours of time, and there's the risk of a blow to the ol' "I'm a smart guy" ego, lol)
- Nice, feels pretty resolved to me now. Clearly worth *trying* - no expectation, gut sense says this looks difficult and outside of my element, but why not give it a go, could unlock a new path
# Maybe it's not hard at all
- I could totally imagine my friends being like "dude this isn't a big deal"
- I've been realising recently that I have a tendency towards overwhelm and like "omg this thing is so hard"/"it's intractable"/"it's beyond my skill level"
	- Kinda "fixed mindset" shit
	- Rather than "growth mindset" like "wahoo, sounds interesting, let's give it a shot!"
- I think I can hear "policy" and think like "oh god, that's like, advanced shit, I didn't do a political science degree" etc. 
- Vs maybe it's really not a big deal
- ![[Handling my feelings about doing an FRI work test123.png]]
- I think I can patiently do each step and not freak out
## 1. Pick a policy debate
- Feel free to select any topic; we recommend selecting a topic with which you’re **already familiar**.
	- This set off overwhelm alarm bells of like "eeee but I don't know anything about any policy debates"
	- *But*, I am a person who (like everyone), lived through COVID for example, so it seems like I can pick one that I'm aware of because it's "in the water", even if I have spent 0 minutes of my life thinking about the policy debate
	- The application didn't say "you must know lots about policy" - you just need to be able to reason, right?
## 2. Summarise the 2 sides of the debate
- This is the classic move of "steelmanning"
## 3. Identify a forecast question that approximates the overarching disagreement
- They provide pointers on how to do this
- Also this is the kind of stuff I do with friends, e.g. in Feb we were planning a group house and I wrote up a thing about my thinking and my key cruxes, key uncertainties etc
## 4.  Identify a question that represents a “crux” in the debate
- I'm not 100% sure how 3 and 4 differ at this point, but I imagine it's simple
## 5. Provide estimate forecasts and a brief explanation
- Again, they provide pointers on how to do this, and an example table
# The test for me is just "can I do this in a level-headed way"
- Writing up the above section, none of this seems wildly beyond me. As I said, the mention of "policy debate" can trigger feelings of "I have spent 0 hours of my life looking into policy debates", but the point of being a generalist researcher is that you just growth mindset-style read into stuff, think about stuff, etc. Which I guess I'm already doing in this doc
