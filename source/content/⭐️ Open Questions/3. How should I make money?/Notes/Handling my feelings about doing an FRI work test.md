- So, I've made it past the initial application stage and have now been invited to do a paid 5-10 hour work trial
- I've taken the day off from my contractor job to do it the work trial (or at least, a big chunk of it)
- But, I'm feeling aversion!
- Then I remembered this banger tweet
	- ![[“'handle your feelings about the task' is the zeroth item on any todo list".png]]
	- [[“'Handle your feelings about the task' is the zeroth item on any todo list"]]
- So, here I am, to handle my feelings
- There are I'm sure very straightforward things leading to the aversion, that will resolve once brought to the light (or, will make a case for "don't do the work trial")
- So, the question is: should I do the work trial or not? 
# In favour of doing the work trial
## Money and stability
- As of the 28th of July → "[[I am now making money!]]"
- However, this is via a contractor operations-y role for an early stage startup, so there's no guarantees that I'll get paid indefinitely, no stability
- I'm also still figuring out how I feel about the role
- So overall, it doesn't feel like *enough* right now
- Also, I'm planning on moving to London soon, so it makes total sense to "income-stability-max", so that I can pay rent etc without dipping into my (mostly depleted from 2 years of post-rat journey) savings
## Potentially cool role
- I need to revisit it to see, but I remember convincing myself that it was worth applying to 
- Of course, being a part time research assistant is very different from being a member of Philip Tetlock's team. But it does get me closer to that world, which seems like it could be a good world to exist in
