title: ORI update & open questions, 2025-08-05 (WIP)
---
- 2025-08-05
- [[⭐️ "What does it mean to be in ORI?" (Open Question)]]
- I haven't really thought about ORI recently, but I'm in the Discord and poke my head in sometimes (mostly to marvel about how out of the loop I am, lol)
# Phases of my involvement in ORI
## Phase 1 → copying his path
- I initially got into it just by reading Defender's post on how he learned to think
- I wrote about it [here](https://www.alexislearning.me/learning-how-to-think/) → "Learning to think the Defender of Basic way - Oh god there’s someone else like me" → about how excited I was to find someone who said that they "learned to think" at 30
- Initially, I copied him → "Defender says that what you should do is have conversations with people on Twitter with an alt, so you can learn more about them and the world"
- See e.g. [[Day 1 of trying to engage people on twitter via alt account]]
## Phase 2 → elucidating my open questions
- "Oh wait, I'm applying what worked for Defender, but I don't have the same open questions that he had"
- His obsession was something like "why don't people agree?" or "why don't people realise that we've figured stuff out" or *something*, I forget exactly what
	- So, creating an alt and engaging with people in good faith, to figure out their world view etc, solved a problem for him
	- But, I have no interest in this stuff!
- So, phase 2 became the phase of ==elucidating my own open questions==, and they came pretty quick!
- It's crazy to think that before this, this isn't what I was doing. I was doing stuff like learning about John Boyd, doing Math Academy, because... it'll educate me... it might be useful one day.. etc → rather than asking "what are my current burning questions"
	- Why so low agency?
		- Partly it may have been a feeling of intractability → "obviously I'm not gonna read a book about how to fix my exact family, clearly it's not something I can solve". Too much looking *outside*, thinking that the knowledge is *out there somewhere*
		- A feeling of overwhelm, a blind spot (always looking outside, meaning you never introspect → your problems become "ugh fields", and you'll never stumble across them, because you're never looking where they are)
		- [[The streetlight effect]]
		- ![[the streetlight effect.png]]
## Phase 3 (not begun, and the profundity has not "clicked" yet)
- Defender has messaged a few times about cultural engineering, and obviously, open memetics is like, his whole thing
- So far, it hasn't clicked for me how this could be relevant for me. But there is obviously strong evidence that there's a "there"
- So yeah, he's messaged me sometimes about cultural engineering stuff, but it's never resonated with me. 
- Feels abstract, and like... I'm not worried about propaganda and dark memetics atm, I'm trying to solve my burning problems (e.g., what do I do about my family, how do I make money) - worldly shit?
- I'm kinda the resident normie in ORI, and it's a role that has a fair amount of resistance
	- The (in my eyes) slightly schizo people are having a great time, saying a bunch of (to me) mostly incoherent shit, seemingly at the cutting edge of various things (e.g. "reality is information"). They seem to think they're gonna make loads of money from this kinda stuff, somehow, soonish
	- Vs I'm here trying to figure out how to ruminate less about my family, how I should make money, etc
- Defender has messaged a few times like "does cultural engineering resonate with you", and "have you tried sharing your writings with people, tweeting your open questions?"
- The main threads that are alive for me currently
	- "Oh man I'm such a normie compared to the people in the Discord" vs "destigmatise being dumb"
	- "Oh man my concerns are so like quotidian/worldly/non-scalable" (e.g., thinking about my family rather than like, shaping culture or whatever the hell) vs "normies are useful because... it's useful to have people around who are grounded... etc?"
	- "The things I'm trying to do haven't been solved" (?)
# Investigating phase 3 stuff
## Attention markets & engineering culture
- DoB sent this post to me ([How attention markets work](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/how-attention-markets-work)) and asked if it resonates at all
### Then I said
> "the post doesn't resonate much beyond an initial 'oh, this sounds like a cool way for me to discover new exciting cutting-edge stuff like blowtorch theory and observer theory!'"

> "but just from a like, "layperson who likes to read about potentially cutting edge stuff" POV"

> nothing about "intentionally engineering culture" has resonated with me to perhaps that's enough signal that i'm just not there atm
### My lack of excitement about engineering culture as a failure on DoB's part
- *What Defender said:*
- "I take this as a failure on my part"
- "I tried to answer this here:"
	- [The pitch for open cultural engineering](https://defenderofbasic.github.io/notebook/memetics/The-pitch-for-open-cultural-engineering)
#### (A) → "dark memetics"
- but TL;DR it's that at least some % of everything you know is engineered, not true (including politics, but also history, and science). 
	- The goal is to learn enough about how propaganda works to have a fighting chance at making sense of the world/for all of us to be less manipulable
#### (B) → "your problems are solved problems, you just don't realise"
- I think the selling point I was trying to articulate is like, most problems in our world today already have solutions, but the environment is too noisy, so we don't hear about them, and so they don't get done
    - ☝️ that's an insane claim right? most people don't believe it. 
    - Because if it's true then it means most effort, most grants, are wasted money. 
    - People spend millions of dollars and thousands of man hours trying to solve problems that already solved, just that none one is paying attention and, that random people in society can fix this problem. 
    - Just by learning to cut through the noise, to find something true & amplify it
## Attention markets and engineering culture doesn't feel relevant? 
- So initial gut sense is something like, "for the problems that *I'm* trying to solve, there aren't solutions that I can just like, plug-and-play, because I still have to be the one to like, *do the thing*"
### "Social sciences"-type stuff vs hard science-type stuff?
- E.g., is it true that the culture has already solved how to help my family? 
	- And I just need to get better at prompting the universe, remembering that I'm a cell inside an organism? [[ORI idea - the universe (you're a cell inside an organism)]]
- Or is something like "learn about family systems theory, convince family to go to therapy, iterate from there" as good at it gets, and still requires a lot of work from me?
	- Or perhaps someone has "solved" it and it's a different thing, it's "dude don't even bother with family therapy, you can't change other people, you just need to do 1000 hours of metta meditation" or something
		- Or "dude DFW has already provided the road map in This is Water"
			- [[What "This is Water" means to me (WIP)]]
	- This is why I'm skeptical re: fixes about this kind of thing - it seems very person-dependent. Like, maybe there is frontier knowledge that solves problems in *maths* or something, but my very quotidian everyday concerns feel much more akin to the social sciences or psychology or something - no "real answers", no concrete truths, etc
		- But, maybe I'm just not realising that these things are in fact solved, it's just not commonly known?
	- Like, if I'm trying to figure out some shit like Observer Theory, let's say, then if I "post into the void" enough, someone may reply like "oh shit this other person is working on this too!" and then we work on it together, we progress the theory, we predict things (e.g. what Blowtorch Theory did), and we... monetise it or some shit
		- A la → [[ORI idea - the universe (you're a cell inside an organism)]]
	- Vs it feels at least intuitively like something as specific as family stuff won't have a similar kind of "feedback loop"?
		- Like, someone else with the same family setup as me
			- (But then, maybe all people, all families are actually very similar? Like, "complex adaptive systems" vibes - complex emergent properties arising from very simple local rules? Maybe I'm totally wrong that a family is more complex than like, Observer Theory, lol. May be incredibly myopic. Maybe this is way simpler than I'm imagining?)
### Maybe I'm being dumb and forgetting how to think
- I'm acting like "don't you get it, my open questions are unknowable!"
- Vs approaching them like a scientist → making predictions, running experiments, etc.
- I wonder if the stuff I'm working on, because it's so quite emotive and personal (how do I make money, what do I do about my family, how do I think better) → maybe I've been in a bit too like, blended with the anxiety and overwhelm, rather than zooming out and being like "ok, scientist mode, let's go"
- So maybe phase 3 is something like getting more scientific, a more neutral observer? Idk
# Like, what am I trying to solve?
- [[⭐️"How can I improve my ability to think? (Open Question)]]
	- If there was someone smart in my life who could peer into my brain and say like "yes, you're already a good thinker, you can pause this", or like "oh dude, it's crazy that you don't know [topic], you gotta rectify that ASAP", that'd be great...
	- I'm paying a philosophy/ethics tutor 
		- ([[Superprof tutor lesson 1 (The Fundamental Decision)]])
- [[⭐️"How can I change how to orient to my family?" (Open Question)]]
	- See the above re: how this feels very difficult to "solve" like an exact science? (I may be wrong)
- [[⭐️"How should I make money?" (Open Question)]]
	- As far as I can tell, this is something that is very personal (because it relates to my personal interests, personality type, need to find projects that are super alive for me and aligned with my "mission" or "gifts", whilst also paying), and thus isn't something that has already been solved by the culture?
	- Unless e.g. I'm believing false propaganda here
- [[⭐️ "What do I do with the things I love?" (Open Question)]]
	- This is a new one, not many writeups on it yet, but I've been deeply, autistically passionate about various things in my life, and like, idk what to do with the knowledge/passion
- [[⭐️ "What is next for me after living at my mum's?" (Open Question)]]
	- Gut sense is "group house in London with my good friend Simmo and some other people we can rustle up"

## DoB looking at my open questions
- for the question of "getting better at thinking", 
	- where does the role of emotions/intuition fall for you in the pursuit of truth? 
	- Like, do you have a way to not let "emotions get in the way of your rational processing"?
		- <span class="text-red">Honestly, no, I'm not great at preventing emotions from getting in the way of rational processing</span>
			- <span class="text-red">But this... feels like a good thing to me? Like, not being a disembodied, alexithmic, left-hemisphere-captured rationalist</span>
			- <span class="text-red">E.g., I wrote up a thing about whether I should go to a friend's bday thing in a different country, and the writeup (and the Guesstimate model I made, lol) clearly showed that going was a good idea. But I even after the rational writing up and weighing up options etc, it still just felt like a "no" in my body, so I trusted that, which felt good</span>
   - New job
	- I'm also curious how your (potential) new job is going, but also understand if you don't want to reflect on that publicly
		- <span class="text-red">It feels too early to say anything too definitive yet - today was my 7th work day. It's been *ok* - it's not thrilling, it's not terrible. I may be able to make it better, or there may be key incompatibilities, I'm still trying to figure this out... could for sure say more privately</span>
   - Friendships
	   - ![[Thinking about open cultural engineering and my resistance to it (2025-08-05).png]]
    - have you tweeted this / and or have people in mind that you'd like to be in a study group with, and have you tried @ ing them / asking them?
		- <span class="text-red">Oh, perhaps my wording was unclear → these are the things I currently do. I'm also planning a group house for ~October. This feels like a solved problem!</span>
# Ok, but so obviously DoB thinks that cultural engineering is relevant to me?
- Is that because:
	1. He sees that my "problems" are fake? Downstream of "dark memetics"?
	2. Or, is it because he's saying that my problems are solved, and I just need to "probe the universe" better?
		- [[ORI idea - the universe (you're a cell inside an organism)]]
		- However, I only have ~150 twitter followers, it's hard to probe 😅
