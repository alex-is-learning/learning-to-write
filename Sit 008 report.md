# Pre-Meditation Preparation
- **Date & Time:** 2025-08-03  22:00
- **Planned Duration:** 1 hour
- **Technique:** [[Ānāpānasati (Anapanasati)]]
### 1. My Motivations
- _(Why am I choosing to practise right now? What are my deeper, long-term goals?)_
	- I want to get over the "beginner mind", "99.9% distracted" default state, so that I can unlock further meditation benefits (e.g. daily metta)
### 2. My Goal for This Session
- _(What is the specific, achievable aim for this sit? What stage am I working on?)_
	- I'm on stage 2 of TMI
		- "Interrupted Attention and Overcoming Mind-Wandering"
	- I want to continue counting my breath (scaffolding), relaxing and celebrating the "aha" moment (sati)
### 3. Anticipating Hindrances
- _(What challenges might arise? (e.g., sleepiness, noise, restlessness, specific thoughts). How will I meet them with patience?)_
	- I am guaranteed to get lost in thought
### 4. Commitment to Posture
- _(Is my posture stable, aligned, and relaxed? I commit to maintaining stillness as best I can.)_
	- Yep, got my meditation cushion setup
### 5. Reviewing the Master Plan
- _(I am currently practising at "The Mind Illuminated" Stage ___. The main skill to develop is...)_
	- See point 2
### 6. Generating Diligence & Enthusiasm
- _(I am grateful for this opportunity to practise. I will engage wholeheartedly for the entire session.)_
	- It's true! I'm grateful to be on this path. I'm also *really* grateful that vibe-coding is a thing → I love my "take a photo of me every 5 mins" python script
# Post-Meditation Reflection
- **Actual Duration:**
- **Proof image**:
### 1. General Impression
- _(Without judgement, what was the overall flavour of this sit? (e.g., calm, restless, sleepy, focused, agitated, clear, dull))_
	- 
### 2. Key Experiences & Observations
- _(What do I remember? Note specific events without needing to analyse them yet.)_
- **Attention on the Breath:** _(How was my connection with the meditation object? Was it clear and vivid, or faint and inconsistent?)_
	-     
- **Mind-Wandering / Forgetting:** _(How frequent was mind-wandering? Did I remember to use the "aha!" moment? Did I notice moments of "forgetting" (Stage 3+)?)_
	 -    
- **Dominant Distractions:** _(What were the main types of distractions? (e.g., planning, memories, sounds, physical sensations))_
	-   
- **Moments of Stability or Clarity:** _(Were there any periods, even brief ones, where attention felt stable and effortless?)_
	- 
### 3. Challenges Encountered
- _(What was most difficult about this session? Did the hindrances I anticipated arise? How did I work with them?)_
	- 
### 4. Insights & Learnings
- _(What, if anything, did I learn about my mind or my practice today? Did I realise anything new?)_
	- 
### 5. Intention for Next Time
- _(Based on this reflection, what is one small thing I can bring into my next sit? (e.g., adjust posture, focus on a gentler return, be more diligent with labelling))_
